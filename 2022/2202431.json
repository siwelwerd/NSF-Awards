 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores a new technologically assisted method of engaging learners with complex systems content. The project will make use of passthrough Augmented Reality (AR) on Virtual Reality (VR) headsets to create a Mixed Reality (MR) immersive participatory simulation for classroom use. This participatory simulation will be a shared \u201csystem of systems,\u201d wherein small groups of students each work collaboratively with a subsystem, each of which is interconnected with other subsystems, such that changes in one subsystem can impact the behavior of other subsystems, or impact the system as a whole. This way of representing systems is well-suited to illustrate the complexity of real-world systems like watersheds and fisheries, and engaging learners with real-world problem solving by undertaking the roles of people like civil engineers and fishery managers. The MR system will overlay a simulated setting on top of the classroom space, and further allow learners to access specialized informational displays that support their role-based engagement with the system.\r\n\r\nThe research will use: (1) a mix of techniques (interaction analysis, qualitative coding, and small case studies) to understand the learning processes undertaken by the students and how they intersect with designed elements of the learning experience; (2) surveys to gauge students\u2019 engagement with and immersion in the experience; (3) pre-post interviews, tests, and attitude surveys to measure changes in students\u2019 complex systems reasoning and attitudes towards STEM; and (4) a grounded theory approach to coding a mix of observational notes and feedback data gathered from students and teachers to identify what types of social, technological, and pedagogical supports are needed to engage learners in complex systems reasoning within an immersive MR participatory simulation. The contribution of the project lies in its ability to shed light on the value of a novel method of engaging learners with complex systems, and on the technological strides it will make contributions towards developing a platform that allows a classroom of learners to be simultaneously engaged in a shared, spatially- mixed reality simulation. The results will advance understanding of integrating mixed reality into classroom settings. The developed platform, two participatory simulations, support materials, and a design Wiki will be made publicly available for others to use, or to replicate or construct similar simulation experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
