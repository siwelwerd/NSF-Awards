 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for junior researchers to participate in the 7th Coordinating Panel for Advanced Detectors (CPAD) Workshop to be held at Stony Brook University in November, 2022.  The main goal of the workshop is to explore and evaluate detector research & design opportunities, needs, and the challenges ahead for Elementary Particle Physics (EPP) in the US within the context of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel Plan.  The Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel is a scientific advisory panel tasked with recommending plans for U.S. involvement in particle physics research.   The workshop will also have topical discussions for instrumentation needs for the upcoming Electron Ion Collider to be constructed at the Brookhaven National Lab in the vicinity of Stony Brook. There will be a variety of synergistic topics that concern both fields of physics, EPP and Nuclear Physics in a similar matter.  Involving junior researchers in this workshop will provide an opportunity for them to learn about state-of-the art instrumentation and train for future careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
