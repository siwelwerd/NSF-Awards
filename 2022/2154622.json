 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jing Zhou of the University of Wyoming is working to develop economical, thermally stable, and active catalysts for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) technology. DRM simultaneously utilizes two abundantly available gases, methane and carbon dioxide, and provides a route to convert these into industrially important synthesis gas (syngas, CO/H2). In this project, Dr. Zhou will study the growth of Ni-based bimetallic particles supported over a ceria support, and elucidate the effect of the second metal (Co and Rh) on the activity and stability of Ni in DRM. Dr. Zhou will be actively engaged in outreach efforts to recruit, teach, and mentor female undergraduate and high school students. Through providing hands-on research experience and workshops in nanoscience and catalysis, she encourages them to pursue their careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nDeveloping economical, thermally stable, and active catalysts that can show good resistance to deactivation is one of the grand challenges for the development of the dry reforming of methane (DRM) technology. Ceria is a promising support for Ni due to its unique redox properties, high oxygen storage capacity, and strong metal-support interactions. Addition of a second metal could provide the ability to tune the properties and chemistry of Ni. This project will involve several steps including: the preparation of model Ni-Co and Ni-Rh particles with controlled structures, compositions, and coverages on well-defined CeOx(111) (1.5<x<2) with controlled degrees of Ce reduction (Ce3+/Ce4+); the detailed characterization of their sizes, chemical states, surface sites, metal-metal and metal-ceria interactions; as well as the examination of activation of reactant gases and catalytic performance in DRM ranging from ultrahigh vacuum to reaction conditions. The chemical state of the catalysts and the nature of the active sites under relevant DRM conditions will be investigated using ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in collaboration with Dr. Senanayake at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Professor Zhou will actively engage in efforts to recruit and mentor female students at all levels and encourage their pursuit of career paths in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
