 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nMaterials at the nanoscale have evidenced a wide and remarkable set of properties that make them suitable for many applications.  The behavior of nanomaterials under various external stimuli, such as temperature, mechanical forces, pH, etc., has been widely investigated.  However, the interaction of nanomaterials with ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, remains largely unexplored.  Investigating potential phenomena and understanding the interaction mechanisms of ionizing radiation with matter at the nanoscale is an unknown question in materials chemistry and will generate valuable information to allow the use of such structures in nuclear science and technology for applications in medicine, power transducers, energy storage, radiation sensors, and actuators.  This collaborative research proposal will investigate a novel class of multicomponent nanomaterials responsive to both low and high energy X-rays.  This research will have a tremendous educational impact on the Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering program at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU).  The new knowledge in materials and radiation chemistry, advanced nanomaterials synthesis, and manufacturing will be disseminated in the undergraduate and graduate courses.  The research proposed here will also be a significant boon for the nuclear science at James Madison University (JMU) and will include undergraduates in the interdisciplinary-research projects.  The diverse experience the students will gain while working on this interdisciplinary project will create a multitude of opportunities for those seeking careers in nuclear engineering, applied photon science, nanoscience, accelerator physics, or medical physics, as well as for those directly entering the workforce in nuclear industry or government.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThis research project will advance both the fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanism of radiation dose enhancement and the radioluminescence response upon the nanocomposites interacting with high-energy photons.  The work will build upon the theory of radiation interaction with matter and expand on the surface and interfacial effects in aqueous media that lead to the radiation enhancement phenomenon. This project focuses on three key areas: 1) Expand on the controlled synthesis of multicomponent nanomaterials to explore their mechanisms of interaction with ionizing radiation; 2) Investigate their radioluminescence and radiation enhancing properties; 3) Implement computational models based on Monte Carlo simulations to assess the contribution of the physical enhancement to the radiosensitization properties of the nanomaterials based on their chemical compositions and morphologies.  The experimental work will involve chemical, electrochemical, and spectroscopic techniques to quantify reactive species involved in the radiation enhancement and the materials' optical properties.  Computational work will be carried out using GEANT4 particle transport code to model the interaction of the X-rays with the studied nanostructures.  Ultimately, this research will establish correlations between the material structure and properties in the solid-state, specifically considering the effects of the X-ray parameters such as the energy spectrum of the X-ray beam and the rate at which the energy is delivered to the system have on the behavior of the materials systems.  Overall, the proposed experimental and computational tools will lead to an understanding of the structure-property relationships of the nanomaterials and will advance the synthesis, evaluation, and simulation of radiation enhancing and radioluminescent nanomaterials to enable their implementation in various fields. Overall, both the undergraduate and graduate students involved in this work will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience in an accelerator-based environment at the JMU's Madison Accelerator Laboratory while participating in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research both at VCU and JMU.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
