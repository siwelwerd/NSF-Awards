 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by exploring a novel approach to supporting undergraduate biology students as they transition from course-based research experiences (CUREs) to internship-based research experiences. CUREs offer the advantage of involving many students in undergraduate research. However, mentored internships in faculty research laboratories provide more opportunities for students to engage with the scientific community. Since faculty research laboratories have limited capacity, internship-based research experiences are often constrained to small number of well-connected students. This project plans to explore a flexible, two-semester undergraduate research experience that aims to provide an inclusive, supportive transition to internship-based research while also expanding faculty research laboratory capacity to deliver high-quality, mentored student research experiences. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are multi-pronged, and project activities will be developed in the context of California State University Northridge, a Hispanic Serving Institution. First, the project will develop 2-semester courses that serve as a bridge between CUREs and internship-based research experiences within biology faculty laboratories. Additionally, the project aspires to introduce undergraduate biology students to a variety of research areas by incorporating short internships within the courses, as well as provide post-CURE supplemental mentoring through academic credit for students engaged in internship-based research experiences. Further, the project will conduct systematic assessment of this transitional undergraduate research experience, investigating its impact on student perceptions of research and career intentions and comparing this to outcomes from standard CUREs. This fully immersive research experience is a potential model for other campuses to increase the capacity of biology departments to involve more undergraduates in authentic research experiences. The assessment outcomes from the project have the potential to advance understanding of strategies that enhance student interest in and preparation for research-related careers. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE: HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate\u2019s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
