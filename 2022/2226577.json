 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports undergraduate participants in three meetings of the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC) series. The first will be hosted on October 21-22, 2022, by the University of Texas at Austin. In fall 2023, TUMC will be hosted by the Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, and in fall 2024 by University of Texas at Tyler. The conference series focuses on research done by undergraduate students or in conjunction with undergraduates. These conferences offer undergraduates the opportunity to see the research being done by their peers and to start the transition into the larger community of mathematical research.\r\n\r\nNow in its 17th year, the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC) seeks to provide students with a forum to present their work, to discover research opportunities, and to learn more about graduate school and non-academic careers in mathematics. Conference attendees often come from groups that are underrepresented at research conferences: TUMC recruits many students from community colleges, Hispanic serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and institutions having many first-generation college students. As part of this vital link between underserved undergraduate students and the mathematical research community, to increase participation TUMC will be run without any associated cost for undergraduate participants. The Executive Committee for TUMC will collect information about subsequent activities of student and faculty participants to investigate the ways in which the uptake of research activities occurs in the year after attending TUMC. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website: http://sections.maa.org/texas/tumc/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
