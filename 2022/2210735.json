 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid growth of social network platforms brings opportunities as well as challenges to identify, extract, and investigate the users\u2019 sentiment on subjects of scientific and public interest. This research project aims to identify the sources of social network heterogeneity. The project will study the likelihood of replies to a posting as well as the propagation of sentiments through a social network. Results of the study are expected to help identify sentiment exchange patterns through interactions between users; detect sub-networks of posts with emotional clusters or exhibiting sentiment polarization; and understand how contagious sentiments propagate through the network of Twitter posts. The project will be integrated into multilevel education through graduate student advising, modernized graduate course components, undergraduate research on carefully devised small problems, and outreach to high school students. Broad participation will be encouraged through partnerships with organizations promoting STEM among under-represented groups. Results from the project will be shared via public repositories for data/codes, software packages, online tutorials, and social media. \r\n\r\nDynamic networks are formed among Twitter users by evolving tweets on a certain theme (e.g., depression) through retweets, replies, and mentions, which are critical in sentiment analysis. Existing dynamic network models not accounting for heterogeneous behavioral patterns cannot provide adequate fits for large, real networks. This project aims to tackle two sources of heterogeneity in dynamic network modeling: reciprocity in emotion sharing and similarity clustering in terms of behavioral features. The investigators plan to develop two novel models that modify the preferential attachment (PA) model. The first one retains the scale-free property and allows personalized heterogeneous tendencies to generate reciprocal edges. The second model is a practical spatial superstar PA model that allows a higher level of interaction among nodes of closer social ties measured in a feature space. Their theoretical properties will be studied via rigorous asymptotic analyses. Inferences about the model parameters when fitting observed networks will be developed through likelihood-based, Bayesian, moment-based, and extreme value approaches. Implementations of the models and inferences will be made publicly available via user-friendly, open-source software packages. All the methods under development will be validated through simulation studies, and the validated methods will then be applied to dynamic networks from Tweets on mental-health-related tags.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
