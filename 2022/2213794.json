 "awd_abstract_narration": "The severity, frequency, scope, and sophistication of cybercrimes and cyberattacks have exploded in recent years, which resulted in huge financial damages to organizations, and threatened the critical infrastructures (e.g., energy grid, water safety, transportation, health care) and the most basic foundation of our society. While a host of open-source technologies for cybersecurity and for artificial intelligence have been developed and used by researchers in each community; research opportunities that leverage both of these technologies to tackle problems at the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence are not broadly accessible to cybersecurity community and AI community due to challenges, such as protection of sensitive information in network data, limited ground truth data, zero-day vulnerabilities, evasive malware, and processing voluminous and high-dimensional network data.\r\n\r\nThis Planning-C project, conducted in collaboration between Pennsylvania State University,  Merit Network, and University of Texas at Arlington, aims to broadly solicit inputs from the cyber security and AI research communities regarding (1) research opportunities of cybersecurity that can be addressed using artificial intelligence, and (2) associated infrastructures needs that are not broadly available to the research communities.  A tangle output of the planning workshop is to generate and publish a report in a suitable venue.  The outcome of this planning project will identify critical cybersecurity problems that can benefit from AI-enabled solutions as well as infrastructure requirements for these AI-enabled cyber security research that are not broadly accessible to the cybersecurity community and the AI community. \r\n\r\nThe identification of these research opportunities and infrastructure needs at the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence will expedite the selection, integration, and adaptation of relevant open-source software tools and infrastructures, as well as the creation of new tools, as needed.  These tools and infrastructures will not only accelerate the critically needed advancement of cyber security solutions using AI, but also broaden the participation of early career scholars and students from under-represented groups in STEM in these research opportunities to further enhance the diversity of next-generation cybersecurity and AI workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis CCRI-Planning C project successfully convened a diverse group of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity experts from 25 organizations (20 academic institutions ranging from community colleges to R1 universities, 4 industry partners, and 1 government agency), located in 16 different states across all regions of the nation, to engage in a series of four half-day on-line workshops, spreading over two weeks (from Jan 20, 2023 to Feb 3, 2023) for identifying (1) research opportunities and challenges in cybersecurity that can be addressed using artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), and (2) associated infrastructure needs necessary for accelerating and democratizing research tasks for addressing existing and emerging cybersecurity challenges via the auspices of AI/ML.\n\n\nDiscussions of each day/session built   on  outcomes of proceeding sessions, while they were all connected by a common thread involving  three inter-related high-level topics: data acquisition and sharing, data  analysis, and data governance. The focus of the first day of the    workshop was Scoping--- identifying important    cybersecurity research problems that may be addressed by AI/ML. This discussion at the workshop    identified research areas related to cybersecurity    and AI, which are summarized in Table 1 of the Workshop Report. The second day of the workshop started    with Visioning, imaging future headlines in (1) data acquisition and    sharing, (2) data analysis, and (3) data governance. One of the future    headlines that were highlighted in the final report is Immune System for Cyberdefense ---    Cybersecurity and AI research community has risen to the challenge of    securing critical national cyberinfrastructure by developing a cyber-immune    system. The system is capable of detecting a host of different types of    attacks and respond to them in ways that allow the system to recover and    continue to function in the face of sophisticated attacks.  Inspired by these visions, the workshop participants identified critical challenges and research opportunities for data acquisition and sharing, data analysis, and data governance. These challenges are summarized in Section 2 of the workshop report.\n\n\nBased on challenges identified by the   community, the third day of the workshop focused on Designing our   Approach. More specifically, workshop   participants were organized into three groups, each group focusing on one of   the high-level topics (data acquisition and sharing, data analysis, and data   governance), for brainstorming approaches, at the community level, the   national level, and the individual levels, for building the envisioned   tangible and intangible infrastructures that would help the AI/ML and cybersecurity   communities overcome some of the challenges. These approaches are summarized   in Section 3 of the workshop report.\n\n\nThe focus of the final day of the   workshop is Identify the Infrastructure.   Based on the approaches generated from Day 3, workshop participants   identified high-priority infrastructure needs, which were classified into three   broad categories: (1) data storage, collection, and analysis, (2) development   of standards, policies, and legal frameworks, and (3) needs for support   infrastructure, education, skill development and training. These infrastructure needs are elaborated   in Section 4 of the workshop report.\n\n\nDuring the final hour of the workshop, an   unexpected theme emerged -- the   community of researchers that contribute, share, and use data, infrastructure   and other resources, for performing research at the interface of AI/ML and   cybersecurity needs to further grow, be diversified and enhanced. Toward this community-building need,   workshop participants identified characteristics of a high-performance   community: (1) being inclusive and having a trusting culture, (2) driven by   shared purposes, (3) empowered by artifacts, (4)  supported by processes, (5) making societal impacts, and (6) being a community  that fosters next generation researchers. This final outcome of the workshop  is summarized in Section 5 of the workshop repor.\n\n\nThe  workshop report has been distributed to all participants of the workshop to  solicit inputs and feedback. The final report is available on the Web:\n http://faculty.ist.psu.edu/yen/AICyberWS/NSF_Cybersecurity_AI_WS_report_FINAL.pdf\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\n\nThe workshop identified critical   opportunities for training and educating next-generation cybersecurity and AI   knowledge workers, and attracting under-represented groups in STEM to careers   related to cybersecurity and AI, using an infrastructure that integrates real-world   cybersecurity problems, associated data, and exemplar AI/ML solutions for   reducing the barriers for educators, students, and practitioners to   boot-strap personal hands-on learning experiences for solving real-world   cybersecurity problems using AI. The workshop also identified   a critical need to design and broadly disseminate training materials for   people with different levels of knowledge. By leveraging existing high performance computing (HPC)   resources, these training materials can democratize the research capacity for   educators, researchers, practitioners, and next-generation cybersecurity/AI   knowledge workers to develop scalable AI-enabled solutions for cybersecurity   problems.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnYen\n"
