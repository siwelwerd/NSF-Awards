 "awd_abstract_narration": "If a group of people is given local clocks with arbitrarily set times, and there is no global reference (for example GPS), is it possible for the group to synchronize all clocks by only communicating with nearby members? In order for a distributed system to be able to perform high-level tasks that may go beyond the capability of an individual agent, the system must first solve a \"clock synchronization\" problem to establish a shared notion of time. The study of clock synchronization (or coupled oscillators) has been an important subject of research in mathematics and various areas of science for decades, with fruitful applications in many areas including wildfire monitoring, electric power networks, robotic vehicle networks, large-scale information fusion, and wireless sensor networks. However, there has been a gap between our theoretical understanding of systems of coupled oscillators and practical requirements for clock synchronization algorithms in modern application contexts. This project will develop systematic approaches for bridging this gap based on combinatorial and probabilistic methods. The use of discrete oscillators will be a key thread in developing more robust and efficient clock synchronization algorithms, extending the current proof techniques for convergence guarantee, and providing a foundation for a data-driven approach to the clock synchronization problems.  This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels \r\n\r\nOne of the key difficulties in analyzing the behavior of coupled oscillators lies in the cyclic hierarchy in the phase space. A widely used observation in the literature is that, if all initial phases are concentrated in an open half-circle, such a cyclic hierarchy disappears and we have robust synchronization results in various settings. Hence deriving global synchronization from arbitrary initial configurations not only warrants self-stabilization of the clock synchronization algorithm under arbitrary perturbation, but also addresses the theoretical limitation of such a half-circle condition. By extending techniques such as local concentration and adaptive pulse-coupling scheme due to the PI, the project aims at deriving global synchronization from an arbitrary initial configuration on undirected finite trees, for non-identical natural frequencies and non-zero propagation delay of signals with optimal bounds on convergence time. The convergence result will be extended to arbitrary graphs by combining with a spanning tree algorithm, and the composite algorithm will be implemented as a fast and resource-minimal clock synchronization algorithm for modern wireless sensor networks. This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels. In particular, some of the projects involve generating a large database for the collective behavior of some models of discrete coupled oscillators on finite graphs, and applying machine learning techniques to extract key features of the pair of network topology and initial configuration that guarantee synchronization. The project will provide students with research experiences ranging from dynamical systems to computer science and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For a distributed system to perform high-level tasks beyond an individual agent's capability, it must first solve a \"clock synchronization\" problem to establish a shared notion of time. The study of clock synchronization (or coupled oscillators) has been a significant research area in mathematics and various sciences for decades, with applications in wildfire monitoring, electric power networks, robotic vehicle networks, large-scale information fusion, and wireless sensor networks. However, a gap exists between our theoretical understanding of coupled oscillator systems and the practical requirements for clock synchronization algorithms in modern applications. This project has developed systematic approaches to bridging this gap using combinatorial and probabilistic methods. It also includes interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels, particularly through intensive summer research experience for undergraduates (REU) programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong><br />The PI has developed two research lines to understand synchronization of coupled oscillators, focusing on mathematical and computational aspects.<br />Mathematically, the PI has employed combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to analyze coupled oscillator models on specific network topologies, particularly finite trees and infinite 1-dimensional lattices. The PI's Firefly Cellular Automata (FCA) model has demonstrated optimal synchronization time complexity of \\(O(d)\\), where d is the network's diameter. This result was achieved through a novel proof technique involving analyzing local dynamics to show constant-time collapse into quarter-circle concentration, with this local dynamics cascade toward the root at a constant speed, leading to the O(d) complexity. The PI also discovered a combinatorial phase transition in the model regarding the number of states in the system versus the tree's maximum degree.<br />Moreover, the PI developed new combinatorial and probabilistic analyses to establish the \"overcoupled regime\" for range-extended FCA. In this phase, oscillators are slightly overcoupled, resulting in degeneracy of cyclic interaction within a single oscillation cycle. It was conjectured that in this phase, local objects generating waves of excitation at a constant speed would persist, protecting themselves from external waves by the waves they generate. This phenomenon was first observed in classical cyclic cellular automata (CCA) by Fisch and Gravner, but establishing it for FCA has been challenging. The PI developed a mathematical analysis technique to classify local defect dynamics, reducing their potential dynamic patterns by investigating their behavior at the boundary between defective and non-defective regions. This new finding and technique are likely to impact the analysis of similar systems of oscillators and excitable media. Moreover, this result may help resolve the conjecture on the global synchronization of 2D FCA, where simulation suggests that local defects are key to the characteristic \"wave collapsing\" phenomenon.<br />Computationally, the PI pioneered using machine learning to predict the synchronization behavior of coupled oscillators on graphs. The PI demonstrated that various binary classification algorithms (e.g., neural nets, logistic classifiers, random forests) could successfully predict the long-term behavior of a new system of oscillators on highly heterogeneous graphs after being trained on a large dataset of synchronizing and non-synchronizing examples of various coupled oscillator models (e.g., Kuramoto, FCA, Greenberg-Hastings). This shows that despite the nonlinear models on heterogeneous graphs not being fully understood in the literature, machine learning models can separate synchronizing and non-synchronizing classes. Furthermore, the PI developed a more interpretable machine learning model for synchronization prediction using supervised matrix factorization, which the PI recently developed through publications in top machine learning conferences. This method extracts key interpretable patterns of local dynamics on subgraphs likely associated with eventual synchronization or non-synchronization. When a new system is given, these patterns serve as filters in a convolutional neural net to compute the predicted probability of eventual synchronization. This approach, while gaining significant interpretability and scientific inference, offers rigorous theoretical guarantees and competitive performance against more complex black-box machine learning models. This research may impact how researchers understand and analyze complex dynamical systems, emphasizing developing data-trainable models for machine learning-based predictions that fit observed nonlinearities.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br />The PI has conducted two funded REU programs (2020 at UCLA and 2022 at UW-Madison) involving nine students with financial support, followed by extensive research advising for 1-2 years, resulting in publications in *Scientific Reports* and a preprint under review. The success of this project showcases that REU programs can produce high-impact research papers, providing motivated undergraduate students with critical experience in professional research projects. The PI also advised the senior thesis of Agam Goyal from REU 2022, which resulted in an oral presentation at an international conference on complex networks.
