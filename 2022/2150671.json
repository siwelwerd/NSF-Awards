 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will serve the national need to develop equitable and effective science teaching practice by building capacity to investigate the use of video analysis tasks in teacher preparation.  Through a cross-site collaboration, a plan for a longitudinal study focused on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools will be developed. The COVID-19 pandemic gives new urgency to video analysis as large numbers of teacher preparation programs have had to use digital libraries of classroom video cases in lieu of traditional field experiences in schools. In addition, the importance of how teachers are prepared to enact equitable, justice-oriented, culturally responsive, and linguistically sustaining pedagogies in support of the success of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education cannot be underestimated.  This project builds upon five years of prior work of the seven institutions involved in which the partners discussed, designed, and studied video analysis within science teacher preparation and developed the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (FAVSTE).\r\n\r\nThis project involves a collaboration of science teacher educators from partnering universities (the Collaborative) including Vanderbilt University, Texas State University\u2014San Marcos, Teachers College\u2014Columbia University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the University of Northern Iowa, Florida International University, and Kennesaw State University who will work with partner high-need school districts. The project has three main intents regarding capacity building intended to situate the Collaborative to be well-positioned to submit a Track 4 Research proposal. One is to continue to analyze and modify the FAVSTE framework and associated tools to ensure that they explicitly support noticing for equity. A second is to identify, modify, and pilot research instruments to analyze teachers\u2019 professional vision, its link to equitable science teaching practice, and how this vision changes over time in relation to teacher effectiveness and retention. And the third is to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research study that incorporates practical instructional tools for video analysis and research tools for studying effectiveness and retention of STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Data collection and analysis consistent with a design-based research approach will be used. The work will allow the Collaborative to deepen its theoretical and methodological understanding of how to use video in teacher preparation to support equitable science teaching practice. The project intends to disseminate insights and best practices emanating from this project through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), a partner of the Collaborative, as well as professional organizations including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE). This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce Program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

J. Johnson, Vanderbilt University; $24,250), 2150631 (PI L.T. Escalada, University of Northern Iowa; $14,249), 2150650 (PI J.F. Riccio, Teachers College, Columbia University; $14,250), 2150651 (PI M. Forsythe, Texas State University; $31,500), 2150652 (PI A. M. Arias; $14,119), 2150671 (PI B. Criswell, West Chester University; $14,260), and 2150708 (PI: J. Ellis, Florida International University; $12,000); 7/2022-6/2023. This project accomplished three goals: (1) to evaluate and modify the Framework for Analyzing Video in Science Teacher Education (See FAVSTE image within attached posters.) and associated tools to support noticing for equity; (2) to pilot research instruments to analyze teachers? developing professional vision and its link to equitable, effective science teaching practice; and (3) to develop a cross-site, longitudinal research methodology that incorporates the aforementioned tools and research instruments. <strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> The activities of this project enabled the team to develop a research strategy that includes rich measures of teacher candidate growth in their pedagogical practices. These measures capture data in ways that are consistent for pooled data collection across sites but also responsive to the unique needs and strengths of the various teacher preparation programs. Pilot data was used to develop evidence-based models for preparing and supporting science teachers across contexts. From this work we developed a video-based approach in science teacher education that fully integrates equity concerns with the development of general capacities related to professional vision that have the potential to better prepare candidates to effectively teach in high-need school districts. <strong>Broader impacts:</strong> Through design-based research methodology, we created new approaches for supporting the development of noticing for equity in science teacher education, which impacted over 100 teacher candidates during the year-long study. Project pedagogical tools and research findings have been shared at Noyce Summits, ASTE conferences, and with teacher education faculty at the seven different institutions of the project team (See attached posters.). The work of this Capacity Building project was also used to develop a competitive Noyce Track 4 research project that was submitted in August 2023 and, if funded, will impact over 200 science teacher candidates, 70 induction teachers, and 5,000 K-12 students. This work broadens STEM participation by explicitly attending to equitable practices in science classrooms, giving attention to student voice as primary in learning, and contributing to places where teaching shortages may be critical. Through the multiple universities across seven states, the project?s implications will impact the design of teacher education programs and induction programs across the U.S., as faculty in teacher education will be able use the project outcomes to apply to other teacher education programs, reaching more future STEM teachers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brett&nbsp;Criswell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2150671/2150671_10787753_1696193608321_2023_FAVSTE_Noyce--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2150671/2150671_10787753_1696193608321_2023_FAVSTE_Noyce--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ASTE 2023 Presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2150671/2150671_10787753_1696193608321_2023_FAVSTE_Noyce--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ASTE 2023 Presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is our poster presentation titled Cultivating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Building Capacity for Cross-Site Research on Promoting Noticing for Equity and Equitable Science Teaching Practice through Video Analysis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna Arias</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brett&nbsp;Criswell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ASTE 2023 Presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2150671/2150671_10787753_1696193704316_ModelsofUse_NOYCE2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2150671/2150671_10787753_1696193704316_ModelsofUse_NOYCE2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FAVSTE Models of Use\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2150671/2150671_10787753_1696193704316_ModelsofUse_NOYCE2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FAVSTE Models of Use\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This shows our application of the FAVSTE across different teacher education contexts</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna Arias</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brett&nbsp;Criswell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FAVSTE Models of Use</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
