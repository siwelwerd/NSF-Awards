 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 55th Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference (STDC) will be hosted by Baylor University on its campus in Waco, Texas, from March 9th through March 12th, 2022.  For the first time in the history of this conference series, the STDC will be open to both in-person and remote participants.  By allowing for both in person and remote participation, the 55th STDC will be able to bring together a broad and diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate research and establish connections for future collaboration. The organizers expect to host more than 100 participants from the United States and from abroad on-site, as well as more than 100 remote participants.  A crucial part of the STDC is its involvement of researchers at all career stages\u2014graduate students and early career researchers as well as established researchers\u2014allowing for younger generations of mathematicians to find mentors and to establish their research trajectories. In addition, the STDC makes a conscious effort to promote diversity in mathematics in its recruitment of organizers and speakers, with a focus on ensuring representation of women and underrepresented minority groups. \r\n\r\nThe 55th STDC is structured around five special sessions, each with a focus on one aspect of topology\u2014continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, geometric topology, and set-theoretic topology. The invited and contributed talks of these special sessions and their associated plenary and semi-plenary speakers provide an opportunity for the announcement and discussion of the most significant advances in the various subfields of topology over the last year. In addition, the STDC reserves a plenary address for the winner of the annual Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher award, which is given to an early-career topologist with outstanding contributions to the field. This year, the STDC will also host a workshop on Linear Dynamics, a relatively young subfield of dynamics, aimed at graduate students and early-career mathematicians, as well as a series of open problem, collaboration, and mentoring sessions. These talks and activities provide an excellent framework for the establishment of new collaborative efforts in mathematical research and for encouraging full participation of graduate students and early career researchers. The project will support the travel of invited speakers, graduate students, and researchers without external support. More information can be found on the conference webpage, which is located at https://sites.baylor.edu/topology-conference/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
