 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the participation of US-based researchers in an international conference to be held at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh, June 27-July 1, 2022.  The conference, entitled Fourier Analysis @200, is timed to celebrate the 200th year since the origin of Fourier analysis, a subject that has had a tremendous impact on the modern world. Fourier analysis provides tools for the decomposition of natural signals and operators into simple parts, and efficient reconstruction of such signals and operators from their constituent parts. The week-long conference will bring together internationally recognized experts in the field and will provide opportunities for early career researchers to present their work and form new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe 200th anniversary of the publication of Fourier\u2019s Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur coincides with a remarkably active period in the modern development of Fourier's theory. Developments during the last five years, for instance, have led to insights into the behavior of the wave and Schr\u00f6dinger equations, the resolution of Vinogradov\u2019s mean value conjecture in analytic number theory, and significant progress on fundamental questions in geometric measure theory. These fast-moving developments present a signature opportunity to bring experts from across the globe together to build upon this remarkable recent burst of activity. The presence of US-based researchers at this event will allow for the exchange of ideas and research findings, and will enable these researchers to bring new techniques back to their home institutions. More information on the conference can be found at: https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/fourier200/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes:  International Conference to celebrate 200 years of Fourier analysis\n\nNSF DMS-2154020 \n\n \n\nThe project facilitated the attendance by nine early-career, US-based researchers at the international conference, Fourier Analysis @200, June 27-July 1, 2022, as well as the Young Researchers Symposium in Harmonic Analysis, June 23-24, 2022,  both held at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Edinburgh, Scotland. \n\n \n\nThe Fourier Analysis @200 conference brought together leading researchers from around the world to discuss recent developments at the cutting edge of Fourier analysis.  The main speakers? talks provided invaluable opportunities for the supported participants to learn more about the state-of-the-art in their field of research.  Informal networking opportunities, such as coffee breaks and a conference dinner facilitated the formation of new collaborations and connections with leading international researchers, and a public lecture gave participants additional tools for communicating the significance of their work to the general public. \n\n \n\nThe Young Researchers Symposium, modeled on a symposium funded by NSF CAREER grant DMS-1653264, focused on the work of early-career researchers.  Some of the grant-funded participants spoke in this symposium, and all attendees had enhanced opportunities to connect with similar career-stage researchers from around the world. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  The scientific focus of the conference and symposium was on recent developments in Fourier analysis, in honor of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the discipline.  The conference featured twenty-three 40-minute lectures by world-renowned senior researchers from:  the UK, Canada, Korea, Germany, the US, Israel, Finland, Spain, and Italy.  The symposium included ten 40-minute lectures by early career researchers from:  Canada, the US, the UK, Spain, and Finland.  Topics included Fourier restriction and related topics, geometric measure theory, additive combinatorics, and maximal and multilinear operators.  The US-based attendees were able to learn about recent developments in all of these areas and bring those ideas back to the States. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  The symposium was attended by sixty participants from around the world and the conference by 118.  Both meetings provided ample networking and collaboration opportunities for the funded participants, all early career and based in the US.  Some of the participants were able to disseminate their own findings in the symposium.  A public lecture at the conference gave early career participants a model for how to engage the broader public in discussions of mathematical research. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Betsy Stovall"
