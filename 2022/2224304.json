 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lava flows create new, initially sterile habitats. The identity of the initial colonizers of these habitats, subsequent invaders, and the repeatability of this process is important for understanding the establishment of ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling. Identifying steps in habitat maturation also shapes conservation strategies for endangered species and rare environments. These processes are virtually unknown in the anchialine ecosystem, which consists of coastal, landlocked bodies of water influenced by fresh and oceanic waters. Anchialine habitats are rare worldwide but are concentrated in Hawaii. Hawaiian anchialine habitats are home to a diverse array of animals, plants, and microbes, many of which are found nowhere else. In 2018 lava flows from the Kilauea volcano created several new anchialine habitats on the east coast of Hawaii, presenting an exceptional chance to examine how ecology emerges in the anchialine ecosystem. The researchers will leverage this opportunity to detail how these unusual habitats change over time. Microbial and animal communities will be characterized as they become established. This research will advance our understanding of the anchialine ecosystem, especially its microbes, which may prove useful for future medical or commercial applications. Underrepresented groups in STEM (including native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders) will take an active role in this research.     \r\n\r\nHundreds of microbial samples will be collected during a time series in anchialine habitats undergoing development. Microbial community structure will be analyzed using DNA sequencing technology. These \u201cyoung\u201d communities will be compared to ones previously characterized from other, \u201cmature\u201d Hawaiian anchialine habitats. This research will address the repeatability of anchialine community formation and whether new habitats are converging on microbial communities similar to those in established habitats. To complement these microbial analyses, presence and abundance of a keystone shrimp species in the new anchialine habitats will also be assessed. Population genomic tools will be used to test the origins of the colonizing shrimp, as the lava flows may have caused local extinctions in this species. Physiological experiments in shrimp will also be performed to examine thermal adaptations stemming from elevated temperatures due to volcanic activity. Because shrimp act as important grazers on the microbial communities, correlations between shrimp abundance and microbial community composition will also be explored.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Not suprising due to being of potentially short duration, primary microbial succession of new aquatic habitats formed during volcanic activity has received little attention. The anchialine ecosystem, which includes coastal ponds in young lava flows, offers an opportunity to examine this process and this project characterized microbial communities of anchialine habitats in Hawaii that were created during volcanic eruptions in 2018. Benthic samples from three habitats were collected&nbsp;&sim;2 years after their formation and at later time points spanning&nbsp;&sim;1 year. Sequence profiling of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities was used to test whether communities were similar to those from older, established anchialine habitats, and if community structure changed over time. Microbial communities from the new habitats were distinct from any&nbsp; established anchialine microbial communities examined to date, having higher proportions of Planctomycetota and Chloroflexi but lower proportions of green algae. Each new anchialine habitat also harbored its own unique communities of organisms relative to other habitats. While community composition in each new habitat underwent statistically significant changes over time, they remained on a distinctive trajectory from prevously established anchialine habitats over the study period. New habitats also had macro-organisms apparently adapted to highly elevated temperatures due to geothermal activity compared to the other habitats. These results suggest that idiosyncratic microbial consortia form during early succession of Hawaiian anchialine habitats. Future work should include monitoring to reveal whether the early communities described here remain stable after temperatures decline and macro-organisms become more abundant, or if microbial communities continue to change and eventually resemble those of established habitats. This work is a key first step in examining primary volcanic succession in aquatic habitats and suggests young anchialine habitats may warrant special conservation status.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Scott&nbsp;R&nbsp;Santos</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2224304/2224304_10664687_1711398527532_Sterlingetal2022ICB_COVER--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2224304/2224304_10664687_1711398527532_Sterlingetal2022ICB_COVER--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ICB 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2224304/2224304_10664687_1711398527532_Sterlingetal2022ICB_COVER--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ICB 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover of ICB from 2022 showing sampling of a Hawaiian ancialine habits.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Scott R.
