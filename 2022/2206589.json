 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) Critical Science project from the University of Colorado is to understand the role of sound waves on the lower atmosphere of the sun. This project will examine how the waves are excited and how the conditions in the atmosphere change the dynamics. This will be studied using two different codes, whose outcomes will be compared with each other and be used to design an experiment for NSF's DKIST. This project supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science by examining an understudied layer of the sun - the chromosphere. The broader impacts include support for a graduate student and an early career scientist. Outreach talks using the 3D data generated are planned through CU Boulder's public talk series. The results would also be made available to the Fiske Planetarium and the Nature, Environment, Science & Technology studio. \r\n\r\nThis project will use simulations and forward models of DKIST observations to examine the role of acoustic waves in the solar chromosphere. The results of two 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic codes, MANCHA and Bifrost, will be examined to determine how acoustic wave excitation events and atmospheric preconditioning change the thermodynamics and ionization state of the chromosphere. The results will be assessed for observational implications and forward models of DKIST specific observations will be constructed to guide experiment design for an observing proposal to be submitted to DKIST.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
