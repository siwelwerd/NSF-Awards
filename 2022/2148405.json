 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lee waves are an example of internal gravity waves forced by stably stratified flow over bathymetry. Oceanic internal lee waves have horizontal wavelengths between O(1\u201310) km that bridge mesoscale currents and smallscale turbulence and play a central role in the ocean\u2019s energy cascade. Their generation exerts wave drag on balanced flow and extracts mesoscale energy, and their propagation transports this energy through wave-fluxes. When they break, they convert energy downscale to turbulent dissipation and mixing, maintaining ocean\u2019s stratification and in turn contributing to the largescale circulation. This project will examine why observed dissipation in the deep ocean downstream from flow-topography interactions is smaller than predicted by the common assumption of equating lee-wave generation with dissipation. This research will determine the role of lee waves in dissipating versus redistributing energy for better parameterizations of wave drag and mixing for oceanic general circulation models. This project will support an early-career lead PI, a graduate and two undergraduate students to be trained on wave dynamics and ocean modeling.\r\n \r\nRegional numerical modeling with Process Study Ocean Model (PSOM) will simulate the generation, propagation, interaction and dissipation of lee waves in mean shear. PSOM is a non-hydrostatic ocean model that has been widely used to study submesoscale processes. The PIs will extend prior idealized simulations to explore a range of topographic variations to examine mechanisms that may suppress turbulence in the lee of flow-topography interactions. These mechanisms are: (i) nonlinear generation due to topographic blocking and splitting, (ii) reabsorption of lee-wave energy back to the sheared mean flow, (iii) remote dissipation in the form of free waves that escape the localized generating current, and (iv) downstream advection of lee-wave energy from localized generating topography. Among these mechanisms, reabsorption will occur for trapped lee waves in bottom-intensified currents, while nonlinear generation and downstream advection have a strong dependence on specific, as opposed to random, topographies. The primary analysis tool will be energy conservation budgets for different components (mean jet, lee waves, and free waves) to quantify the dissipative and non-dissipative fates of lee waves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe ocean and atmosphere are coupled so that weather - rainfall, storms, storm surges, flooding and droughts - are controlled in part by the air-sea interactions and weather forecasts depend on fully understanding ocean budgets of temperature, salinity and momentum. Wind drives the largescale ocean circulation and eddy fields. However, the damping mechanism that acts to maintain a steady budget is not well understood. Lee waves, generated by flows over bottom topography, have been proposed as the dominant energy sink for the mean circulation and eddy field with the assumption that lee-wave generation is all dissipated as turbulence. But turbulence measurements in the Southern Ocean, where it is thought that half of ocean lee-wave generation occurs, fall short of linear generation predictions. This research has followed the proposal that a significant fraction of lee-wave generation is reabsorbed back into the mean flow so is not all dissipated. It used idealized numerical simulations to explore the energy budgets of lee waves and was able to rule out both (i) reabsorption by the mean flow and (ii) radiation of free internal waves to dissipate far from lee-wave generation sites as significant sinks. Ongoing research by the scientists involved will next examine whether nonlinear generation by flow over more realistic bottom topography leads to reduced generation, specifically by largescale topography modifying the flow field felt on lee-wave generating scales, and the role of form drag.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/17/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricKunze\n"
