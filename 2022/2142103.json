 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a new virtual laboratory software application to help students learn thermodynamics concepts. Introductory undergraduate thermodynamics is a foundational course in many engineering majors. However, students often have difficulty understanding and visualizing the complex concepts taught in this course, creating a barrier to students\u2019 academic success. Active learning experiences for students have been shown to be effective in improving student learning outcomes. Virtual laboratories are digital learning environments that can provide active learning lab exercises for students using a simulation of a system. This project will recruit thermodynamics instructors from diverse institutions to provide input on the design of the virtual laboratory application and to implement the application in their courses. The study will examine how real time analysis of student actions while using the application can be used to assess student learning. The software application will be available to the public along with a collection of curated instructional support materials such as laboratory assignment handouts, quizzes, and presentations. Project results will be disseminated to engineering educators at professional conferences and in publications focused on engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to improve student learning outcomes in introductory thermodynamics courses. The project plans to conduct a workshop of thermodynamics instructors that represent a diversity of educational contexts, practices, and needs. Participants will use an existing prototype application, determine design constraints, define use cases, identify best practices for teaching, and brainstorm potential virtual laboratory challenges. The workshop results will guide the design and development of the virtual reality application so that it will be aligned with the different educational contexts. Participants will be asked to integrate the application in their thermodynamics courses and to provide feedback to the project team. The project includes three research questions: (1) How do different engineering instructors integrate VR-based virtual laboratories into their introductory thermodynamics coursework? (2) How does a VR-based virtual laboratory support student learning of introductory thermodynamics concepts? (3) How can student learning be assessed using stealth assessments embedded within the virtual laboratory itself? A cross-case analysis method will be used to synthesize findings across all of the instructors\u2019 implementations and contexts. Qualitative methods will be used to derive key themes of player interaction and self-perception of learning as well as traditional statistical methods to analyze differences in student assessments. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
