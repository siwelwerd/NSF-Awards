The 2023 GRC \u201cIntegrating Ocean Physics and Biogeochemistry to Assess Polar Ecosystem Sensitivity to Rapid Change\u201d will provide powerful insights into the present and future states of polar marine ecosystems, including the local and regional aspects of ocean circulation, sea ice dynamics, biogeochemical fluxes, biodiversity, ecosystem health and human well-being. The 2023 GRC-PMS, with the title \u201cIntegrating Ocean Physics and Biogeochemistry to Assess Polar Ecosystem Sensitivity to Rapid Change\u201d, will provide powerful insights into the present and future states of polar marine ecosystems, including the local and regional aspects of ocean circulation, sea ice dynamics, biogeochemical fluxes, biodiversity, ecosystem health and human well-being as well as technological advances in sampling approaches in these harsh environments. These key facets will be addressed through the presentation and discussion of new observations and findings, conceptual frameworks and numerical simulations during the nine sessions of the conference. Partial travel support and full registration are requested for 10 invited speakers / discussion leaders and 10 early career participants.\r\n\r\nThe Gordon Research Conference (GRC; March 5-10, 2023) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS; March 4-5, 2023) on Polar Marine Science will be held at the Four Points Sheraton / Holiday Inn Express in Ventura, California, USA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
