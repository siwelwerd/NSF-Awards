 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physicists tend to adhere to a broad notion that quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when physical systems are very small and very cold (compared to something called Planck\u2019s constant).  More recently, however, as technology has allowed us to routinely work with individual atoms (very small) using laser cooling (very cold), we have a better understanding of how information flows between the environment and the system under study.  This has revealed some loopholes in the expectation that hot systems are necessarily non-quantum.  This research program is exploring some of the ways that well-controlled dissipation, a potentially hot and typically classical process, can help us to control and use quantum systems for measurement and computation.  For this, the group will use a single atom levitated in a vacuum chamber and study how \"hot\" things like sunlight shining directly on the atom can be cleverly employed to cool the atom to nearly absolute zero for quantum information applications that will help us advance scientific understanding and harness quantum information for the greater good.\r\n\r\nAs the size, complexity, and precision of quantum devices employed in practical applications grows, these instruments push closer to the fuzzy boundary between thermodynamic and unitary behavior. A dual challenge arises to improve practical instruments and better understand the transition between the statistical and quantum realms. This program will explore these challenges using trapped atomic ions with long-lived metastable electronic states (a highly quantized subsystem) interacting with classical light from lasers and thermal sources (a highly classical subsystem).  This project will address three key questions: 1) Can more powerful trapped atom processors or sensors be created by tapping into the larger resource of available stable atomic levels? 2) How can the nearly ideal projective null measurements (PNMs) in such a system enable new processing primitives? and 3) What happens when these quantum measurements are pushed toward the classical regime by bringing the system into contact with a hot, thermal reservoir such as the sun?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
