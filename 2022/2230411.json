 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of a methodology that could mitigate the spread of oil-based coolant and the formation of oil mist that represents a safety hazard through inhalation or as a fire hazard. The proposed technology may produce an adjustable and varied methodology for cooling for use in the grinding industry. The technology may be of interest to industries that experience inner diameter grinding, where the material is removed from a part to finish its inner surface. The link between the manufacturing of the nozzle, design of conditioner (device for reduction of turbulence within coolant liquid), and jet spread is important for other material processing technologies including forming and cutting technologies. The efficient cooling could reduce heat pollution of the environment, which is substantial in the grinding industry.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a multi-scale and multi-phase fluid dynamics computational model of coolant jet and the potential production of hardware including a nozzle and conditioner for a long coherent jet. The proposed technology may be able to predict the disintegration of a coherent jet and improve the cooling efficiency by optimizing nozzle and conditioner settings for varying grinding situations. If overheating is not managed properly during grinding, thermal damage may occur including tensile residual stresses, discoloration, softening, re-hardening, and cracks. The proposed technology could place the nozzle in direct proximity to grinding situations, and the evaluation of jet coherence by the proposed technology could also assist in the prediction of the need for replacement of the nozzle, which can be timely manufactured using 3D printing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Grinding is a type of abrasive machining process which uses a grinding wheel as a cutting tool. &nbsp;The proper cooling by coherent (laminar) jet is crucial for grinding.&nbsp; If the heat is not managed properly in grinding, it can lead to thermal damage such as tensile residual stresses, discoloration, softening, re-hardening, and cracks. To control temperature and material removal rate right is the major way to maximize grinding efficiency and minimize thermal damage to workpieces.</p>\n<p>For example, a very small aberration in the quality or the microstructure of the grind surface could lead to a significant amount of product being recalled. An R&amp;D engineer of a leading company admitted that they are still looking for better solutions in this area. The major goal of exploring customer ecosystem in frame of the current NSF I-Corps Teams award is to formulate and adjust value proposition based on customers' interviews. A Director of Engineering&nbsp; described how a precise and non-turbulent (coherent) coolant delivery could save enormous volumes of coolant fluids which would save money. &nbsp;&nbsp;This statement was reiterated by a few senior engineers of larger companies interviewed. The goal is to identify a market of machining companies where our product fits.</p>\n<p>The customer discovery approach included (1) the interactions with production facility/machine shops in industrial zones of Northeastern Ohio; (2) attended trade shows in Ohio and other midwestern States national and international trade shows such as one in Stuttgart, Germany and one in Chicago, IL and (3) attended professional conferences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;typical manufacturing engineer is challenged with improving productivity and lowering costs. His efforts center around the ability to run processes faster, reduce re-work, and extend tooling life. The engineer overcomes coolant delivery challenges as best as possible through trial and error (i.e. a variety of standard nozzle designs are tried until an acceptable product is found) or consults with a nozzle designer. There are very few nozzle designers. For processes of turning, grinding, and forming, controlling the generation of heat and the dissipation of heat are crucial to meeting the key performance indicators (KPIs). In each case proper delivery of coolant is a key. In terms of coolant delivery, the process engineer must determine the optimum amount, pressure, cavitation and location to minimize friction and maximize cooling.&nbsp; Adding to the difficulty of doing this are physical constraints on piping and nozzle sizes (given machining and workpiece clearances) as well as flammability and waste treatment issues. Generating an engineered, coherent, coolant stream of ideal size for a given fluid viscosity, flow rate and pressure is a necessary condition to meet process engineer goals of improving productivity and lowering costs.</p>\n<p>The flexible manufacturing operation requires frequent and rapid change of location of nozzle, direction of jet and coolant rate that can be achieved using proposed numerical modeling and 3-D printing of nozzles. The scaling-up of the grinding speed and mass flow rate of coolant cause coolant jets to become prone to earlier transition to turbulence and jet spread that can be mitigated by using the proposed methodology.</p>\n<p>The preliminary development goal of the project is to look for efficient nozzle designs to be used in the grinding industry for coolant application purpose, namely, to produce effective coherent jet for the maximum downstream distance compared to generic nozzles used in the industry. Traditional grinding coolant jets become turbulent quickly and spread in surrounding air. The entrainment of ambient air substantially decreases the liquid coolant volume fraction, speed of jet and its momentum. The jet spread does not allow the coolant jet to effectively breach the high-speed air boundary layer &mdash; created by entrainment of air along the surface of rapidly rotating grinding wheel &mdash; and gain access to the hot wheel-to-workpiece interface. The coherent (laminar) jet should be sufficiently long to maintain its initial velocity (nearly columnal) to penetrate the layer of air rotating with the grinding wheel.&nbsp;The proposed coherent coolant jet can remove heat more efficiently and with less coolant volume as it maintains its momentum and does not mix with ambient air prematurely. Upon developing its concept and refine its design by computer simulations, presented in master&rsquo;s Thesis of the Entrepreneurial Lead and then running physical experiments using the equipment purchased by the current grant, NSF MRI grant (purchase of Spraytec device) and local Spark grant on 3-D printed nozzles, our purpose is to look for scalable business models using this product. The 3-D printed nozzle is shown in Fig. 1, the 3-D printing set-up and process are depicted in Figs. 2-3. The Spraytec laser detection of jet breakup pictured before break-up and after break-up are shown in Figs. 4-5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/22/2024<br>\nModified by:
