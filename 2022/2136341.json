 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 1 project is to advance the development of germicidal optical fibers (GOF). GOFs side emit ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation along their entire length like a glowstick. Their use in tight channels of homes, businesses, and hospitals can eliminate pathogenic bacteria and viruses that cause operational issues, infections and even deaths. The ability to distribute ultraviolet radiation into tight channels outranks the current biofilm prevention approach of using chemical management or surface modification that works for a short duration (days), damage surfaces and produces harmful by-products. This technology holds promise for extension to other industries in biomedical devices, home appliances, air purification and water systems. \r\n\r\nThis project will advance the manufacturability of GOFs from a non-scalable dip coating process to a draw tower. GOFs consist of two parts: a) a light engine that houses a UV-C LED and b) a UV side emitting optical fiber. UV-C light (265 nm wavelength) is sent from the LED through the glass core and scattered by a nanoparticle coating, resulting in emission of UV-C light into the surrounding environment (air/water). Currently, the specific material needed for the manufacturing of GOFs are not suitable for manufacturing in a draw tower, and the technology is limited to 1 m rigid fibers. Therefore, the specific objectives in this project are to (i) innovate the chemistry of the external nano-enabled polymer able to distribute UV-C radiation for draw tower application, (ii) modify the manufacturing steps in a draw tower to enable large scale manufacturing of < 300 \u00b5m diameter for increased flexibility and > 50 m length GOFs and (iii) control nanoparticle positioning in large scale manufacturing to enhance uniform light scattering profile through the length of the fiber.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
