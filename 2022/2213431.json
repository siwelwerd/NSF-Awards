The meeting is intended to bring together the community supported by NSF and Partner Agencies across the breadth of plasma science and engineering. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for a broad segment of the plasma science and engineering community to exchange scientific results on topics ranging from high-energy plasma astrophysics to solar physics and space weather prediction, to plasma medicine and clean energy applications of low temperature plasmas.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the ECLIPSE meeting include (1) widening the scientific community\u2019s exposure to the field of plasma science and engineering, (2) educating the community in its theoretical fundamentals and applications and (3) helping members of the plasma science and engineering community network across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The meeting will include invited talks with generous time for questions and answers, a poster session, and a concluding multi-agency roundtable discussion led by co-chairs of the 2020 Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The meeting presentations will be webcast with the opportunity for online viewing and an online discussion forum for members of the community who are not able to participate in person.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Ecosystem for Collaborative Leadership and Inclusive Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE Meeting 2022) was a meeting whose goal was to highlight the successes of the field of plasma science and engineering (PSE).  Organized after the publishing of the 2020 Decadal Report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), the meeting was a response to the recommendation that, in order to maintain leadership in PSE, federal agencies should jointly support new funding opportunities that take advantage of the interdisciplinary synergies that exist between PSE and different science disciplines.\n\nThe 2-?  day meeting consisted of two morning and two afternoon sessions.  Each session had 3 to 4, 30 minute long presentations (20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes for discussions and questions).  Most importantly, the sessions were organized in a way that mixed topical areas in PSE:  experiment vs. theory vs. computation, and scientific outreach/broader impact topics.  The meeting was attended by approximately 60 persons who gave a mixture of oral (32) and poster (25) presentations.   \n\nOverall, the attendees were very happy to have an opportunity to interact with each other in person and valued the time spent together.  The reception to technical sessions were overwhelmingly positive because of the mixing of topics.  The care that individual researchers took to make their presentations accessible to a broader PSE audience was well-received and allowed this mixing of scientific topics to be generally successful.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward E Thomas"
