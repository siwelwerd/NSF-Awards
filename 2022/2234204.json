 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a novel printed circuit board (PCB) laser micromachining processes. Conventional PCB manufacturing processes utilize wet chemical etching and electroless deposition. These conventional processes require the use of many hazardous chemicals, heated etching baths, and multiple washing cycles requiring excessive water use.  The proposed miniaturized PCBs can be used in space-constrained electronics devices such as mobile, wearable, and implantable medical devices to make them lighter and more compact, creating additional room for a battery at reduce cost.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is focused on the development of novel low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing technology that produces PCBs with higher wiring density than conventional PCB, reducing the PCB size.  The proposed PCB manufacturing technology uses laser-micromachining, a chemical-free process that eliminates the use of harsh chemicals and reduces water and electricity consumption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
