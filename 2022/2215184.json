 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHMLA) for the purpose of acquiring a micro computed tomography (\u00b5CT) scanner. The NHMLA is the largest natural history museum on the west coast of the United States with more than 35 million specimens and artifacts, and receives roughly a million visitors annually. The \u00b5CT scanner acquired for this project will be used for research, exhibition, and educational programs, and will benefit society in numerous ways. Scans will be uploaded to freely accessible websites, increasing equity and access to the museum's collection objects to researchers and students worldwide. Specimens scanned at the NHMLA will create stunning visual and 3D printed displays that will be featured in educational programs and exhibit design. Importantly, use of the \u00b5CT scanner will also train students in critical 3D skills that will transfer over to a wide variety of career applications, including medical, engineering and scientific fields. \r\n\r\nThe \u00b5CT scanner acquired in this project has applications and will directly impact all 22 scientific departments at the NHMLA, as well as outside researchers and professionals throughout the LA metro region. The \u00b5CT scanner will increase our understanding of anatomy and physiology, evolutionary biology, morphology, biomechanics, and mineral sciences, among other fields. All discoveries will be shared in peer-reviewed scientific journals, on websites, and presented at regional and international scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
