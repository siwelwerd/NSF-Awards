 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor James Unwin at the University of Illinois, Chicago.  \r\n\r\nThe need for dark matter to explain astrophysical observations is widely accepted.  However, the nature of dark matter remains one of the central questions in contemporary physics. Moreover, the existence of dark matter is one of the most compelling indications that there are likely new fundamental particles and phenomena to be discovered. Accordingly, research on this topic advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science by furthering our understanding of the physical universe and the laws which govern it. Professor Unwin\u2019s research seeks to better understand the nature of dark matter.   As such, his research lies at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Furthermore, this project will have significant broader impacts including the training of graduate students, the mentoring of high-school and undergraduate students, and the promotion of scientific careers to young women through dedicated outreach events. The results of this research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, seminars, and public lectures.  \r\n\r\nMore specifically, in this research Professor Unwin will seek to develop a new class of dark-matter indirect-detection searches, to obtain new constraints on dark-matter models in the presence of primordial black holes, and to explore novel possibilities that link dark matter to other phenomena, such as the emergence of the observed baryon asymmetry and the process of electroweak symmetry breaking. Indeed, this work is pertinent in its timing since over the next few years there will be new relevant data from multiple complementary experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
