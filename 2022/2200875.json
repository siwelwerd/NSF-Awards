 "awd_abstract_narration": "String theory posits that interactions of fundamental particles at small scales are explained by hidden dimensions of our universe which are wrapped up to form a tiny geometric space called a Calabi--Yau manifold at each point. The mirror symmetry phenomenon asserts that Calabi--Yau manifolds come in mirror pairs X and Y which determine the same physics, implying surprising relations between geometric properties of X and Y. Birational geometry is the study of surgeries of spaces obtained by cutting out a subspace of lower dimension and gluing another in its place. The moduli space of a space Y parametrizes all possible spaces obtained by deforming Y. If X and Y are a mirror pair, then the birational geometry of X determines the structure of the moduli space of Y near a certain limit point. Based on this heuristic, Morrison conjectured that a Calabi--Yau manifold X admits only finitely many possible surgeries up to symmetries of X. The PI aims to show the conjecture is false in general, but a weaker statement sufficient for applications to moduli holds, as suggested by recent work of the PI with graduate students on unbounded Calabi--Yau manifolds. The PI will also study positively curved spaces called Fano manifolds and singularities that arise at limit points of the moduli space of Calabi--Yau manifolds via mirror symmetry. These projects will be pursued together with graduate students supported by the grant. The PI will also organize seminars and a conference focused on training of graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe PI will study Morrison's cone conjecture and applications to birational geometry and moduli, joint with a collaborator. Morrison conjectured that the automorphism group of a Calabi--Yau manifold acts on its nef cone with rational polyhedral fundamental domain, so that a neighborhood of a cusp of the moduli space of the mirror manifold admits a compactification determined by this data via a construction of Looijenga. Recent work of the PI with graduate students on log Calabi--Yau manifolds and mirror deformations of singularities suggests that the conjecture does not hold in general, but a weaker version sufficient for applications to moduli should hold. The PI will study mirror symmetry for Q-Fano 3-folds and applications to classification and non-arithmetic curves on moduli of K3 surfaces, joint with a graduate student. Q-Fano 3-folds arise as end products of the minimal model program and so are basic to our understanding of 3-folds. Mirror symmetry heuristics suggest that the mirror of a Q-Fano 3-fold is a K3 fibration over the affine line with monodromy at infinity that is maximally unipotent after a finite base change. The mirror corresponds to a rigid rational curve on a moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces.  Computations suggest that these curves are not Shimura curves but are uniformized by non-arithmetic groups. The PI will study mirror symmetry for Milnor fibers of surface singularities and applications to symplectomorphism groups and moduli of surfaces, a project that joint with others.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
