 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyzing the STEM enterprise to work collaboratively for inclusive change, is the goal of the NSF INCLUDES program.  Proposals includes alliances, demonstration pilots, and  conferences/workshops organized into cohorts, depending on funding date. This work is in line with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science. The long-term effect of the national network is a STEM workforce that reflects the population of the Nation. While current INCLUDES alliances each have made progress and can demonstrate impact of their individual goals, continuing to work independently will fall significantly short of the combined potential. This project believes that the alliances can come significantly closer to reaching overall INCLUDES program goals by building synergy and collaboration of activities across the alliances. Numerous interactions among Cohorts 1 and 2 leaders have led to the formation of the INCLUDES Community Alliance that proposes a 2-day virtual workshop to bring together and engage all three INCLUDES Alliance cohorts to leverage the collective knowledge, lessons learned, and specific activities to accelerate change in broadening STEM participation (BP) in realizing NSF\u2019s bold vision. \r\n\r\nThe proposed virtual two-day workshop will further capitalize on the synergy generated in the 2021 convening of the INCLUDES Alliance collective.  The organization of the workshop will use an inclusive, participatory approach. There will be full involvement of the Alliance team during pre-conference and post-conference interaction. Attendees and the planning group include members of the CAHSI INCLUDES\u2019 backbone team, NSF INCLUDES program officers and two representatives from of the INCLUDES Alliance Community team. The planning group invitees were selected based on those who have the breadth and depth of experience in and knowledge of working with complex systems to achieve bold goals and objectives. Ultimately, an equitable representation of network members will be present in order to ensure outcomes are usable and appropriate. The Alliances will select which representatives they would like to represent them as there may be emergent leaders who are not in a leadership role.  The event needs representatives who have an overview of how all the parts of the alliance and its goals fit together in order to best determine how each alliance might relate to others. Discussions are ongoing to finalize the agenda and guiding questions, as well as who would be best at presenting at the event. Additionally, the external evaluator and thought leaders have experience working with STEM projects of this magnitude and complexity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The convening built upon a session from the 2021 NSF INCLUDES convening, entitled 'Collective Action within the INCLUDES Ecosystem: A Braided River Approach,' that began an effort to map alliance relationships for collective action to broaden STEM participation. In particular, the 2021 session centered on how Alliances might align efforts and examined the possibilities for deeper alignment with an enhanced understanding of the scopes of the other Alliances. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2022 INCLUDES Community convening included pre-convening activities, in-person networking and knowledge-exchange activities, and action-oriented activities post convening. The pre-convening activities involved capturing documentation about each Alliance, existing partnerships, aligned alliances, and areas of needs. The convening activities began with a keynote from NSF program officer, Dr. Tori Smith who emphasized that the INCLUDES Alliances should work towards systems change with demonstrable outcomes and sustainable, equitable scale up. A panel of prominent scholars and theorists of systems change and broadening participation in STEM fields (Drs. Ann Austin, Anne-Marie Nunez, Fay Cobb Payton, and Andrea Venezia) emphasized the importance of intentionality in addressing inequities in complex systems, the importance of collaborative networks in addressing historical imbalances of power, and the vital role of partnerships to change efforts.&nbsp; Attendees discussed ideas that emerged from the panel and reported on suggestions for collective action towards systemic change. Other discussions focused on ways to capture big ideas that can maximize change through emergent partnerships across alliances. The convening ended with reflections from NSF and alliance leaders regarding next steps for cross-Alliance collaborations to expand broadened participation in STEM fields. The outcomes of the convening were the dynamic mapping of intersectional broadening participation efforts across the Alliances, identification of cross-Alliance collaborations, identification of gaps that could lead to areas of investment, and recommendations to advance the Alliances.</p>\n<p>Key recommendations to the Alliance Community, the NSF, and the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the story of the broader INCLUDES Alliance community (Coordination Hub in collaboration with the Alliance Community);</li>\n<li>Create mechanisms for improved collaboration and communication (Coordination Hub);</li>\n<li>Define mechanisms for data collection and sharing across the alliances (Alliance Community and Coordination Hub);</li>\n<li>Establish a repository of tools, instruments, training, and materials (Alliance Community and Coordination Hub);</li>\n<li>Provide support and training for scaling, growth, and change within Alliances, including policy advocacy (NSF);</li>\n<li>Extend support of Alliances moving toward systemic change (NSF); and</li>\n<li>Collaborate to initiate Phase 3 post-convening planning efforts (Alliance Community and Coordination Hub).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\">The post-convening activities involved meetings twice a month with the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub to act on the recommendations and conversations with the National Science Foundation. In particular, the leads from AiiCE, ASPIRE, CAHSI, SEAS, and STEM PUSH, who composed the Alliance Collective Subcommittee to the Coordination Hub, met with Andrea Venezia and other Collaboration Hub members to advise the Collaboration Hub and the NSF on the agenda for the <em>NSF 2023 Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES National Network Convening: Sustaining Equity-Driven Systems Change. </em>A focus of the 2023 NSF convening&nbsp;was to disseminate the results of the INCLUDES Community convening and subsequent strategic actions to address the recommendations. The Alliance Collective Subcommittee worked closely with the Collaboration Hub to plan the pre-meeting, called the Alliance Collective Day, with a focus to: extend the momentum that began at the 2022 INCLUDES Community convening; build and strengthen community among the Alliances; share tools and examples regarding getting Alliances off the ground, sustaining them, and developing work that can scale over time; identify and build strategic partnerships and connections across Alliances and along the Braided River; and strengthen connections with NSF. The Alliance Collective Day meeting aimed to learn from and share ideas with NSF, focused on supporting both content and processes of the work together.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The Alliance Collective Subcommittee continues to work with the Coordination Hub to define a framework for communication and networking, network assistance and reinforcement, and visibility and expansions of the Alliance and its partners. These efforts are contributing to a new structure for alliance projects, being defined by the Collaboration Hub, which is based on the intensity of their focus on systems change.</p>\n<p
