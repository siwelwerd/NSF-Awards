 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Ohio community needs assessment with 240 respondents showed 21% of manufacturers in Northwest Ohio have unfilled skilled positions, due to a regional skills gap. This challenge has highlighted the importance of skilled Electrical Maintenance Technicians to Ohio industries. This project will collaborate with industry partners, aligning the curriculum of a Programmable Logic Control (PLC) certificate to meet their current and future needs.  This will facilitate and expedite both upskilling and employment for students at Terra State Community College. Over the three years of the project, 110 students will complete the PLC Certificate, providing them an advanced understanding of Industrial Electricity and employment in this high-demand field. A Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) will guide this project to define, align and embed key competencies into the certificate. Faculty associated with the project will benefit from professional development, capitalizing on new concepts and technologies to enhance and implement a competency-based hybrid classroom model. This structure will utilize mobile access to online learning modules, a new assessment model, and competency-based outcomes.  Each of these concepts will combine, creating an environment where improved student learning occurs. This flexible curriculum provides greater opportunities for students struggling to balance family and work responsibilities by providing online learning with open lab access. On a broad scale, this project has the potential to improve the diversity of the industry by providing increased access for all students, including underserved populations (e.g., women, minorities, and veterans), as they pursue high-demand, family-sustaining occupations in the technical workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to better prepare students to enter the STEM workforce with relevant classwork and industry experience. Approximately 110 students are expected to complete this certificate over three years.  Between four to six faculty will be trained in Competency-Based Education (CBE) during summer learning experiences. The project will create a series of critical skills assessments to ensure success in the introductory courses, by providing students the requisite technical abilities. Students completing ten electrical courses (and four Gen Ed courses) will qualify for the PLC Certificate which includes two industry credentials. The Business and Industry Leadership Team will demonstrate the scope of skills and knowledge essential to skilled Electrical Maintenance Technicians in manufacturing.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
