 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the spread of diseases in wildlife communities is fundamental to the field of ecology and to predicting the stability of animal populations in an era of global change. This research focuses on one of the most successful pathogens of vertebrates - a skin fungus that is lethal to hundreds of amphibian species - to resolve how generalist pathogens cross habitat and host species boundaries, at times impacting entire ecosystems and watersheds. The project is global in scope, with field sites in three megadiverse tropical frog communities in Brazil, Peru, and Cameroon. By advancing disease transmission theory for diverse wildlife communities, this research will provide novel insights into impacts of emerging diseases and increase our capacity to forecast and respond to disease outbreaks. The researchers will work with the multimedia magazine bioGraphic to produce a video story detailing the motivation and progress of the team\u2019s research in Brazil, with an expected reach of > 1 million views. The researchers will also work with the education department at the California Academy of Sciences to develop and disseminate an introductory video, lesson plan, and interactive game for K-12 audiences that teach the concepts of host-pathogen dynamics and showcase the tools scientists use to study and model these systems. The projected reach is 35,000 K-12 teachers per year.\r\n\r\nOur three-tiered research approach includes 1) field surveys spanning the old world and new world tropics to assess infection patterns in diverse amphibian communities across space and time, 2) a field experiment to isolate the effects of climatic variability on amphibian community structure and disease risk, and 3) novel methods of disease modelling that integrate observational and experimental data to forecast disease dynamics and population demographics at the community scale. A cornerstone of our integrative approach is to examine the disease dynamics of fully terrestrial amphibians. This guild of tropical frogs has been experiencing cryptic population declines and extinctions ostensibly linked to disease, droughts, shifts in host behavior, spatial aggregation, and pathogen spillover. The field survey component will compare spatiotemporal disease dynamics among co-occurring terrestrial-breeding and aquatic-breeding amphibian species, focusing on divergent host movement patterns and responses to climatic variability. The experiment in Brazil will manipulate rainfall variability in large-scale field enclosures to test hypotheses on host movement patterns and infection dynamics of terrestrial- and aquatic-breeding leaf litter frogs. Field surveys and experimental data will be integrated within a multi-host disease modeling framework. This framework will apply recently developed N-mixture models accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection, together with a Bayesian population viability analysis, to predict long-term host population stability exposed to pathogens under future climate scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project explored how climate variability and drought influence host behavior, pathogen transmission, and community-level disease dynamics, using amphibians as a model system due to their diverse life histories and their status as one of the most endangered groups among vertebrates. By integrating bimonthly field surveys, controlled field experiments, and modeling approaches, we investigated the mechanisms by which climate variability shapes the spatial and temporal dynamics of infections caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus&nbsp;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&nbsp;(Bd).</p>\r\n<p>Field studies conducted in Brazil&rsquo;s Atlantic Forest revealed that seasonal rainfall patterns and rainfall variability significantly alter animal behavior and habitat use, modifying host contact rates with aquatic environments where Bd thrives and influencing pathogen transmission. Temporal sampling of thousands of individual frogs of dozens of species varying in their reproductive strategies led to results demonstrating that the majority of amphibian species show elevated Bd infection during wet periods (Figure 1), while terrestrial-breeding amphibians experience elevated pathogen loads and disease following droughts. These results highlight how rainfall variability interacts with seasonal rainfall dynamics and ecological traits to influence disease. For instance, experimental drought manipulations in Brazil&rsquo;s rainforest showed that although drought directly reduces Bd growth, lower water availability drives amphibian clustering in shrinking aquatic habitats, intensifying crowding, leading to skin microbiome dysbiosis and Bd-induced mortality (Figure 2). Modeling efforts partially support these findings, predicting that extended drought periods will disproportionately impact species with limited habitat plasticity. These studies advance the field by identifying how climate variability mediates host-pathogen dynamics and by elucidating mechanisms that underpin climate-driven shifts in vertebrate communities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong>This project trained a diverse group of early-career researchers, fostering interdisciplinary and international collaborations.
