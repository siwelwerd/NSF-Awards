 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable accurate, continuous, and widely available blood pressure (BP) measurements. The current standard of care is single point-in-time BP monitoring using an arm-cuff device. This method has two basic drawbacks: inaccuracy and the inability to measure BP continuously over 24 hours, limiting clinical insight. The major challenge to continuous reliable BP measurements is motion artifacts due to movement, such as an arm gestures.  This project will advance development of a novel device for non-invasive beat-to-beat BP measurement in a cuff-less, wrist-wearable device.  Accurate 24-hour BP measurement at home and other settings will significantly improve outcomes for 1.5 billion people globally who suffer from chronic high BP or hypertension, a leading cause of stroke and heart attacks. Other chronic conditions benefiting from accurate 24-hour BP measurement include sleep apnea, heart and renal failure, and dementia. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes a highly sensitive optomechanical sensor to capture video images of skin displacement over the radial artery to independently measure systolic and diastolic BP continuously. The technology measures BP accurately and continuously in stationary conditions (i.e., seated or lying down). The goal of this project is to identify, characterize and address motion artifacts that occur during routine use in hospital intensive care units and operating rooms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
