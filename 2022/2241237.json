 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: A National Network for Critical Technology Assessment: A Pilot\r\n\r\nAbstract: The National Network for Critical Technology Assessment Pilot seeks to lay the foundation for the ability to assess U.S. global competitiveness on key emerging technologies and identify where and how Federal science and technology investments can be applied to advance U.S. competitiveness and the well-being of U.S. citizens. Using data, advanced analytics, and expert insights, the national network pilot effort will identify methods that could be employed to derive policy insights and develop an understanding of where additional analytical tools and data resources are needed to drive comprehensive analysis and decision-making. \r\n\r\nBringing together a multidisciplinary group of experts, the national network will pair a top-down approach to scan global capabilities in knowledge, production, and human capital with a bottom-up approach to develop and demonstrate methods to identify opportunities for science and technology investment to advance national competitiveness. The bottom-up approach will be accomplished through deep dives in four key technology areas: artificial intelligence, biotechnology, energy storage, and semiconductors. The outcomes of both approaches will be synthesized into a final Critical Technology Assessment report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
