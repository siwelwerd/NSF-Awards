 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve treatment for children with communication impairments. The project will develop a system that provides specialists and parents with reports that have accurate, efficient, and easy-to-understand speech and language evaluations with recommendations and suggestions, for better understanding the children\u2019s communication challenges and how to solve them. It will bridge the gap between a clinical assessment and support at home, impacting clinical outcomes by providing a more accurate assessment of child language developmental needs. Consequently, this will result in more personalized education and treatment, particularly for diverse communities.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses pain points surrounding speech and language assessment with children with communication impairments. The child\u2019s language use must be captured in a natural setting to obtain an accurate analysis. The solution is a flexible, self-customizing system using a trained AI approach to evaluate speech and language skills, then provide analytical feedback in key communication areas. To evaluate a child\u2019s communication skills, the system collects a language sample based on natural adult-child social language interactions. Research objectives include: (1) improvement and development of machine-learning modules, specifically the language proficiency assessment, recommendation engine, recognition of child voices, recognition of accents and dialects, and intonation detection; (2) an autism screener development, to be used as a pre-diagnostic tool with eye-tracking technology; and (3) web and mobile application development for data collection by the child.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
