 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  Rhondale Tso is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM.  This fellowship to Dr. Tso supports his research project entitled \"MPS-Ascend: Probing Fundamental Physics with Next Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors\", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Nicolas Yunes.\r\n\r\nTso aims to facilitate the era of precision tests of general relativity by (i) advancing models probing fundamental physics beyond GR to accurately constrain deviations from classical general relatively and (ii) developing theoretical models characterizing fundamental features of the dynamical formation of black holes that will also display key features of general relativity.  Tso will prepare a translation document of LIGO outreach material to the Navajo language, similar to what has been accomplished with the Siksika (Blackfoot) language. Both languages are documented as endangered languages, thus the project will aid in preserving, sustaining, and revitalizing the language. Tso will be involved in outreach to underrepresented groups as well, in particular to Native American groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
