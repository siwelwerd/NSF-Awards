 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the limited spectrum available in the frequency bands currently used for cellular communications, beyond-5G wireless systems are expected to exploit the large amount of bandwidth available in the THz band (0.3-3 THz). This will require the use of very large arrays of antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver to compensate for the strong attenuation and lack of penetration of signals at these high frequencies. However, scaling up existing radio-frequency technologies to operate over large bandwidths becomes exceedingly complex, expensive, and demands high power consumption. Thus, radical simplifications in the radio-frequency architecture are needed; for example, a sacrifice in the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable when operating across massive frequency and antenna dimensions. This collaborative project tackles the theoretical and practical challenges associated with using very large arrays with digital receivers attached to each antenna and that employ low-resolution analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters. It aims to realize this technology's potential for revolutionizing the physical layer in THz communications. The project adopts a holistic approach that encompasses analytical studies, signal processing methods, and network protocols and leverages rigorous tools from optimization, machine learning, and Bayesian inference. Furthermore, it will foster the research collaboration between the participating US and Finnish institutions and support the cross-disciplinary development of a diverse cohort of Ph.D., Master's, and undergraduate students in key technologies for beyond-5G/6G systems.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the fundamental physical-layer challenges associated with energy-efficient THz communications in beyond-5G systems and is organized into four interconnected thrusts: i) Doubly massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with low-resolution ADCs/DACs at both ends of the link, focusing on the channel estimation, performance analysis, (symbol-level) precoding and decoding design, and hardware non-linearities; ii) Spatial Sigma-Delta processing under realistic array and radio-frequency models, incorporating two-dimensional spatial sampling and carefully characterizing the mutual antenna coupling and out-of-band emissions; iii) Initial access protocols to facilitate the practical implementation of fully digital architectures, focusing on synchronization signal design and signal-to-noise ratio tuning schemes; and iv) Variational Bayesian inference applied to channel estimation and data detection with low-resolution ADCs, to be used in lieu of traditional machine learning models in rapidly time-varying environments. By demonstrating the potential and feasibility of pushing the operating frequencies to the THz realm, the project will stimulate cross-disciplinary research efforts, encourage technological advancements in low-complexity and controllable antenna architectures, and enable new wireless applications with high data rates and low latencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
