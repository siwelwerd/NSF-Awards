 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial visualization is the ability to mentally maneuver two- and three-dimensional objects, and thus is an essential skill for engineering technology students. Research shows that students with poor spatial-visual skills feel discouraged because they cannot complete tasks that seem easy to their colleagues. Consequently, the lack of spatial visualization skills may negatively impact students' performance. These students may switch their majors to disciplines that do not require high spatial-visual abilities.  This RIEF project will develop students' spatial visualization skills utilizing interfaceable Mixed Reality (MR) modules. The MR modules will be incorporated into undergraduate fluid power courses to develop students' cognitive spatial thinking and thus reinforce their problem-solving skills. \r\n\r\nThis research demonstrates a digitized-based technique to develop spatial visualization in engineering technology students. The research will examine the efficacy of integrating state-of-the-art MR technology into advanced engineering technology courses. Interactive MR modules will be employed as a pedagogical tool to study and enhance students' visualization skills. The proposed research will have a broader influence that benefits society in different aspects, including (1) developing spatial visualization skills that are needed in everyday life situations, (2) advancing the infrastructure of STEM instruction and research, and (3) progressing discovery and promoting learning through the implementation of interactive visual representations. Utilizing such MR complex systems for demonstrating engineering concepts will allow students to learn, practice, and become familiar with digitized-based technology. This RIEF project will also develop an instrument to measure students' attitudes towards MR technology in engineering technology courses. The research outcomes will serve as a reference for the academic community interested in MR, spatial visualization, and new teaching methodologies in STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
