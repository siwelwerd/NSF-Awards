 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is both to provide novel, domestically produced raw materials to the US battery supply chain and to generate affordable, safer, fast-charging, long-lasting lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for electronics. With these raw materials, the US can manufacture lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using its own resources; US battery manufacturers need no longer depend on foreign suppliers. The manufacturing process will employ readily available US manufacturing capabilities to generate domestically produced, value-added materials and thus strengthen the high-tech US economy that critically needs new materials for more effective energy storage. Further, the proposed materials will improve battery performance and safety, such as in wireless, battery-powered medical devices (e.g., implants and sensors) that use phone apps to monitor people's health and welfare. These apps need improved LIBs made from novel, lighter, and safer anode materials that can charge faster and store more energy than current versions. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to introduce a value-added active anode material with high-quality performance to the battery supply chain. The anode material aims to reduce the quantity of expensive\u2014but critical\u2014cathode materials (Ni, Co, and others) required for successful battery designs. Funding will enable upgraded production methods to produce anode material at scale, thus demonstrating how to produce a lithiated version of the anode material which will increase its desirability for battery manufacturers. The main R&D activities will improve both key desirable performance value propositions through engineering optimization approaches to synthesis and scaleup, and improve upon the currently low initial coulombic efficiency for the first charging cycle through introducing pre-lithiation and full-lithiation methodologies. Research outcomes include: (1) a value-added active anode material\u2014with higher capacity than graphite mid potential between lithium titanate and graphite, low irreversible lithium capacity loss, and potentially increased lithium availability\u2014to reduce the size and cost of the overall battery system per kWh, (2) a third-party demonstration of minimum viable product 200mAh batteries with superior performance, and (3) a roadmap for battery manufacturers to effectively incorporate additive amounts of the novel, lithiated material (even to completely replacing graphite) in existing battery designs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
