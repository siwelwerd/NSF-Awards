 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 80% of Americans and over half the world\u2019s population live in urban areas. High-density cities are transforming how people live, work, travel, and manage urban infrastructure. With the nation\u2019s urban areas facing emerging challenges threatening livability, safety, and inclusion, it is the streetscape \u2013neighborhood streets, sidewalks, and public spaces\u2013 that marks the nexus of public and commercial activities, where rich, spatially and temporarily dense data can be harnessed for the public good. The NSF Engineering Research Center for Smart Streetscapes (CS3), led by Columbia University, together with Florida Atlantic University, Rutgers University, University of Central Florida, and Lehman College, will develop a rich ecosystem of streetscape applications built upon real-time, hyper-local intelligence to advance livable, safe, and inclusive communities. CS3 will adopt a fundamentally new approach to engineering research, leveraging a diverse cohort of non-academic stakeholders \u2013industry partners, community organizations, municipalities, and K-12 schools\u2013 as collaborative co-producers of knowledge and auditors of technology research and development, built on a culture of inclusion that bridges the \u201cdigital divide\u201d that starkly demarcates stakeholdership. With an extensive network of partners, CS3 will explore five application themes: road safety and traffic efficiency, public safety, assistive technologies for people with disabilities, the future of outdoor work, and hyper-local sensing and modeling. CS3\u2019s engineering process will begin with the study of community-specific application requirements, constraints, and sensitivities. The resulting community-inspired applications will be piloted within three distinct urban testbeds \u2013in New York City (NY), West Palm Beach (FL), and New Brunswick (NJ)\u2013 leveraging prior federal and municipal investments. Outcomes from these pilots will catalyze a novel innovation ecosystem, drawing upon CS3\u2019s broad network of aspiring entrepreneurs, emerging start-ups, and established companies. Realizing and sustaining this vision requires a next-generation workforce that cross-cuts engineering, data science, social science, and policy; CS3 will leverage shared, day-to-day streetscape experiences to attract students from diverse disciplines and backgrounds to engage in the emerging discipline of smart cities. Built on the four closely integrated foundational elements of NSF\u2019s ERC program \u2013Research, Engineering Workforce Development, Diversity and Culture of Inclusion, and Innovation Ecosystem\u2013 CS3\u2019s work has the potential to redefine America\u2019s streetscapes by applying a digital layer over physical urban infrastructure, ensuring that America\u2019s cities meet the needs of local communities and that the technologies being adopted take into account critical questions regarding safety, equity, privacy, and security.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Engineering Research Center for Smart Streetscapes (CS3) will advance livable, safe, and inclusive communities through real-time, hyper-local streetscape applications built on advancements in edge-cloud technology, wireless-optical engineering, visual analytics, computer security, and social science. CS3 will unite diverse research communities through a convergent research model that delivers innovations across five engineering and scientific areas: (1) Wi-Edge \u2013 the integration of high-speed wireless-optical networking, high-performance edge-cloud computing, and software-defined radios and networking; (2) Situational Awareness \u2013 fine-scale, real-time observation, modeling, and forecasting of human behavior over variable time horizons at streetscape scales; (3) Security, Privacy & Fairness \u2013 addressing socio-technical barriers of privacy and security within locally intelligent streetscapes, yielding a software pipeline for streetscape applications that gives community-configurable guarantees of privacy, fairness, and transparency; (4) Public Interest Technology \u2013 understanding how CS3 technologies, applications, and security/privacy policies impact the social landscape and promote regional economic development; and (5) Streetscape Applications \u2013 incorporating the distinct ways in which individual communities read, interpret, and respond to local intelligence within the design process in order to optimize community-specific benefits. CS3 will advance fundamental knowledge in civil and urban systems engineering, electrical and network engineering, visual analytics and sensor fusion, computer privacy and security, and public trust and technology \u2013 catalyzing and coalescing the emerging discipline of smart cities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
