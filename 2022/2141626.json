 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving students\u2019 abilities to reason logically, think critically, and solve complex problems. It will identify instructional strategies for introductory proofs courses that empower students to analyze and solve important problems in advanced STEM settings. Poor performance in proofs courses often serves as a barrier for students\u2019 successful course progression and can prevent them from becoming or remaining as STEM majors. This IUSE Engaged Student Learning Level 1 project at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) is designed to increase and diversify the pool of students pursuing STEM careers. This will be a two-phase project for which phase 1 will include a cyclical approach to investigate student reasoning and to design and study research-based instructional tasks that evoke and address challenges in the teaching and learning of foundational ideas. Efforts from phase 1 will have an immediate impact on every Virginia Tech mathematics major, including pre-service teachers preparing to teach secondary mathematics. In phase 2, project outcomes will be disseminated and used to support introductory proofs instructors nation-wide as they optimize instruction for facilitating students\u2019 development of robust logical reasoning, critical thinking, and overall success in the STEM arena.\r\n\r\nThe project will pursue several underlying goals. The first goal is to provide students taking an introduction to proofs course with opportunities to develop reasoning skills and to incorporate the logical structures that are essential for flexibly solving problems in advanced STEM settings. The second goal is to contribute to the knowledge base and fill gaps in the literature through research findings by investigating: (1) how students experience epistemological obstacles in proofs courses; (2) how course instructors experience these student obstacles; and (3) how to enable these instructors to employ teaching and learning interactions surrounding the epistemological challenges that provide the students with opportunities to realize, explore, and overcome these difficulties. The third goal is to disseminate (through national workshops and other venues) research findings, resources, and a replicable and sustainable course model that promotes student success to instructors, departments, and institutions working to enhance student learning, problem solving abilities, and success in introductory proofs courses and beyond. The project team will take a cyclical approach by investigating student reasoning and designing and modifying research-based instructional tasks for evoking student experience of the cognitive challenges associated with foundational ideas such as logical implication, quantifiers, and proof techniques. Research and task design will draw on action-object theory, which derives from Piaget\u2019s (1970) genetic epistemology and Dubinski\u2019s (1991) extensions. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Robust logical reasoning skills are essential for flexibly solving problems in advanced STEM settings. Crucial to this goal is empowering teachers to evoke instructional interactions that invite students to realize, explore, and overcome persistent&mdash;yet necessary&mdash;learning challenges. Therefore, the project examined classroom interactions surrounding research-based instruction to analyze students&rsquo; ways of reasoning when working on active learning tasks in introductory proofs classes.</p>\n<p>Through video data analysis, we categorized 14 persistent challenges, and we documented students&rsquo; demonstrated ways of reasoning when grappling with these challenges. We identified, designed, and revised instructional tasks for empowering instructors to take these challenges head-on as they support students&rsquo; development of robust logical reasoning. This instructional approach provides an immersive experience for students&rsquo; learning of mathematical language and logic.</p>\n<p>We found that helping students develop a strong understanding of logical implication is crucial, as deductive reasoning forms the basis of mathematical problem solving. We promoted students&rsquo; visualization of logic through Euler Diagrams so they might use their spatial reasoning to solidify their logical understandings. For example, to understand the logical information encapsulated by the implication ``If a number is a multiple of 6, then it is a multiple of 3,&rdquo; students might visualize the set of numbers that are multiples of 6 as a circle nested within a larger circle representing the set of numbers that are multiples of 3 (see Figure 1).
