 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project will advance the understanding of the light-absorption properties of brown carbon (BrC) emitted from wildfires. The light-absorption properties of BrC vary over 3 orders of magnitude, posing major challenges to representing BrC in climate models. An optical distributions framework will be developed to enhance the representation of BrC in climate calculations by accounting for the variability in BrC light-absorption properties and their evolution upon photochemical aging in the atmosphere. This research could make a major contribution to improving the understanding of the role of BrC in earth's climate system.\r\n\r\nThe tasks to be conducted as part of this research are as follows: (1) Simulating wildland fires at the U.S. Forest Service facility; (2) Retrieval of BrC light-absorption properties (optical distributions); (3) Parameterization development; and (4) Chemical transport and radiative-transfer modeling. Biomass combustion experiments will be conducted that simulate wildfires and prescribed fires, and the effects of critical variables such as fuel type, firing techniques, and moisture content on emission profiles will be investigated. Three intensive measurement campaigns will be conducted at the newly built U.S. Forest Service Center for Forest Disturbance Science combustion facility. The BC and BrC emission factors, and their optical distributions, will be derived from these experiments and parameterized as a function of fire radiative power (FRP), a proxy of combustion conditions. The novelty of the framework lies in the utilization of correlations between BrC physicochemical and optical properties to retrieve optical distributions. The parameterizations developed through these studies will combine findings from the measurement campaigns with remote-sensing observations. The parameterizations then will be implemented in WRF-Chem, a coupled chemical-transport and climate model.\r\n\r\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students will receive training through this effort. The project also includes a unique cross-disciplinary education component that involves developing a course that would link University of Georgia engineering students with urban design students taking a regional planning course.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
