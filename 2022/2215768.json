 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to serve the national interest by developing, implementing, and assessing flexible and inclusive Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) to enhance students\u2019 engagement with scientific practices in analytical chemistry courses at four diverse institutions. CUREs have been shown to positively impact college students\u2019 persistence, scientific identity, and learning of both course content and science skills. Analytical chemistry faculty members from Centre College of Kentucky, Skidmore College, The College of New Jersey, and Virginia Wesleyan University plan to develop the CUREs and associated instructor professional development resources to support their use at other institutions in the future. The CUREs to be developed will employ paper microfluidic laboratory materials that are inexpensive, safe, and flexible, which is expected to make them easier for chemistry courses at other institutions to adopt. Additionally, the project team plans to investigate how the CUREs support student learning and engagement in scientific practices.\r\n\r\nThe collaborative project intends to support analytical chemistry faculty members in the use of backward design to develop the CURE materials and assess student learning. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) develop a theory-driven process for the design of flexible multi-week CUREs; 2) develop paper microfluidic technology and support materials for CURE implementation; and 3) assess the impact of the CURE experiences on student learning. The analytical chemistry CUREs to be developed will translate traditional colorimetric assays into a paper microfluidic format with cell phone detection to measure color changes. The project team plans to design the CUREs to support students in engaging in the scientific practices of experimental design and execution, data analysis and interpretation, and scientific communication. Measures of student learning will be selected as part of the backward design process and are expected to include Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills in STEM (ELIPSS) and Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education (VALUE) rubrics. The project deliverables are expected to include not only course materials and results of assessments of student learning, but also scientific results from the research conducted within the CUREs. The NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
