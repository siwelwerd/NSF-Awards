 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS) brings together researchers and practitioners to gain understanding from a range of disciplines united in CPHS systems.  This specific workshop looks to broaden participation in CPHS in the uniquely interdisciplinary and intersection of modeling, analysis and control of integrated CPHS and social and societal aspects of CPHS. The workshop is in Houston Texas, December, 2022.The CPHS community is uniquely positioned to contribute to this goal. By centering the role of humans amidst technology, our subcommunity lowers barriers to enter these fields for researchers with expertise in human-centered fields.\r\n\r\nThe Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS) workshop integrates a broad community of researchers from the core technical fields of control, communication, networking, sensing, and computing with sociotechnical fields including human factors, ergonomics, accessibility, human/computer interaction, rehabilitation, neuroengineering, healthcare, public health, agriculture, and civil infrastructure. Importantly for the broader Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) community, research in this workshop centers on the role of people in the creation of new knowledge and technologies. Broadening participation in the CPS community is critical to ensure research impacts a greater diversity of communities, technologies, and industries than have been historically prioritized. The CPHS subcommunity\u2019s focus on the human interface with technology provides a uniquely powerful draw to technical fields that have marginalized non-majority researchers. This workshop will lead by example in representing and amplifying diverse voices through innovative programming, including the creation of a cohort of CPHS Fellows and presentation of a plenary focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion issues in our research field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
