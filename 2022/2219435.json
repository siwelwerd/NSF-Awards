 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nWith support from the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Minority-Serving Institution (CISE-MSI) Research Expansion Program, this project aims to develop a minimum of 6 new in-person and online cybersecurity research activities and incorporate them into 6 existing courses in the College of Computing and Engineering, focusing on improving the safety and security of critical computer applications, systems, and data. Activities also will include seminars, events, and mentoring to further engage and motivate students, especially Hispanics, Blacks, and women who are underrepresented in STEM. The project will contribute important findings to the body of knowledge in STEM higher education regarding the relationship between academic success, research experiences, and supplemental support activities. Increasing the success of students (especially those who are underrepresented) to pursue high demand STEM fields will contribute to the American innovation economy, and benefit society by increasing underrepresented student graduation leading to increased employment diversity in cybersecurity-related occupational fields. \r\n\r\nThe project team of researchers will enhance the capacity of the College of Computing and Engineering to engage undergraduate and graduate computing and information technology Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Science/Master of Science dual admission majors in the research enterprise by demonstrating the effectiveness of expanding faculty use of technology systems and research-informed instructional approaches designed to broaden the participation and success of all students, including those who are underrepresented in STEM. Faculty will develop instructional strategies that increase student access to advanced tools and resources to bolster preparation for and participation in cybersecurity-related research activities, focusing on building secure system architectures, securing critical components, and examining attack patterns through simulations, including use of artificial intelligence and data analytics. The body of knowledge shared will advance opportunity equity, increasing US intellectual capital for underrepresented students who have the potential to succeed in greater numbers in the Hispanic-Serving Institution environment, bringing a new perspective to conventional instruction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
