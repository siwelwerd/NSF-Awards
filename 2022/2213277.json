 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). PI Takase is awarded a National Science Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Takase supports the research project entitled \"MPS-Ascend: Ergodic Schr\u00f6dinger Operators and Quasicrystals\", under the mentorship of two sponsoring scientists. At the first host institution, Michigan State University, Dr. Takase will work with the sponsoring scientist Dr. Ilya Kachkovskiy, from August 2022 through July 2023. Dr. David Damanik will be Dr. Takase\u2019s sponsoring scientist at Rice University from August 2023 through July 2025. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate the spectral theory of ergodic Schr\u00f6dinger operators, with a focus on explicit multi-dimensional operators that appear in quantum mechanics to model physical phenomena. The PI plans to study Laplacians on Penrose tilings to describe the topological structure of the spectrum, continuity of spectral characteristics of Schr\u00f6dinger operators as the coupling constant approaches zero, and ergodic Schr\u00f6dinger operators with separable potentials. The PI plans to engage with undergraduate research mentorship and professional development activities through directed reading programs. To broaden participation in mathematical and physical sciences, Dr. Takase brings insights from his own experience as a Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellow and his engagement with middle school outreach as a graduate student member of a community educational outreach program called Math CEO. He has participated in several outreach activities at HSIs and HBCUs and plans to continue these initiatives in future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
