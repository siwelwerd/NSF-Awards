 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term survival and coexistence of species in the face of habitat loss and fragmentation is among the most critical concerns faced by ecologists today. This project is an integration of mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of an insect herbivore and predator system to explore the effects of habitat fragmentation, interspecific competition, and predation on the population dynamics and coexistence of species from the patch to the landscape level. Results from this project aim to answer two key ecological questions: (1) For competing species, what effect does the density of the same or different species have on dispersal-reproduction and dispersal competition tradeoffs arising from the evolution of dispersal in fragmented habitats? (2) How does the presence of a shared predator affect the relationship between density and emigration, tradeoffs involving dispersal? The project will also provide significant contributions towards the analysis of mathematical models created to study this behavior via development of new mathematical tools to better understand model dynamics. Finally, results from this study are expected to be applicable to conservation programs and reserve design. This project will involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students through PI-hosted workshops and mentorship of independent research projects. Moreover, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project comprises integrated reaction-diffusion modeling, mathematical analysis, and experimental research to explore the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, interspecific competition, and predation on the population dynamics and species coexistence from the patch to the landscape level. The Investigators will use diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition and predator-prey systems with nonlinear boundary conditions modeling density dependent emigration (DDE) at the patch and landscape levels. Experiments will be performed using two Tribolium flour beetle species to examine how the DDE relationship and life-history tradeoffs are affected by a shared predator (Xylocoris flavipes). This project is expected to be novel and significant by providing (1) experimental evidence that interspecific competitors and predators affect boundary behavior, the strength and form of DDE, and important life-history tradeoffs linked to species coexistence; (2) the first theoretical framework for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species and a shared predator in fragmented landscapes; and (3) a significant contribution toward the analysis of systems of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, as new mathematical tools will be developed to better understand the models\u2019 dynamics. Knowledge of species\u2019 life histories, coupled with predictions regarding how competitors and predators can alter the magnitude and form of DDE and life history tradeoffs, can help determine whether existing reserves are adequate for species long-term coexistence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project was an integration of mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of an insect herbivore system to provide much needed information on the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, interspecific competition and predation on herbivore population dynamics at the patch level and multi-patch (metapopulation) levels. There were two main research objectives: 1) Use experiments and analysis of mathematical models to investigate dispersal-reproduction tradeoffs arising from evolution of dispersal in fragmented habitats and 2) Use experiments and analysis of mathematical models to investigate natural enemy-competitor mediated dispersal and matrix effects at the patch and metapopulation level. We addressed three key ecological questions: 1) what effects do competitors have on a species&rsquo; boundary behavior, emigration behavior and long-term coexistence?; 2) how does conditional dispersal affect the occurrence and strength of competition-dispersal tradeoffs that are thought to be a key to competitor coexistence?; 3) do natural enemies affect emigration, the relationship between conspecific and competitor density on emigration, life-history tradeoffs, and long-term population dynamics within a patch?; and finally, 4) do density-effects on movement, life-history tradeoffs, and species coexistence change when scaling up from single patches to a metapopulation? <br />We completed the above objectives and raised new and important questions that will be addressed in a recently funded renewal of this grant. Key outcomes from this work include the following. 1) We formalized a framework to facilitate the connection between small-scale movement and patch-level predictions of persistence through a mechanistic Lotka-Volterra competition model based on reaction&ndash;diffusion equations. The model incorporates essential information about edge-mediated effects such as patch preference, movement behavior, matrix-induced mortality, strength of competition between species, and effects of conspecific and heterospecific density on emigration. Moreover, our modeling approach allows for the inclusion of natural variability in population growth rates, competitive abilities, response to a hostile matrix and the form of density-dependent emigration. We illustrated the utility of this framework with a model laboratory system involving the flour beetles in the genus Tribolium. <br />Experimentally, we demonstrated that flour beetle dispersal is well-fit by a diffusion model, movement shows a humped-shaped relationship with density and is similarly affected by the density of the other species of competitor. In open patches, where emigration is possible, our experiments and models were in close agreement regarding the long-term coexistence of species. Although T. castaneum generally excluded the other species across a range of landscape contexts (e.g., different patch sizes, permeability of the patch boundary), if we account for natural variation in population parameters, a wider range of population dynamics is possible. Interestingly, when we included a natural enemy to our experimental study, a pathogenic fungus (Beauveria bassiana), we found that the fungus not only caused significant mortality of the flour beetles but also differentially affected their movement behavior. Flour beetles were repelled by the odors emanating from fungal-infected flour and, at least for T. confusum, emigration increased with increasing fungal concentration in the patch of flour.<br />Finally, we also applied our model to issues regarding species conservation and reserve design. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation for different shapes of the density-area relationship (DAR) for a species. The DAR is crucial to the identification of valuable habitat fragments that favor high abundance and the design of a reserve for a target species. We also illustrated how matrix hostility in combination with non-lethal predator effects can influence DAR, minimum patch size, and species coexistence.
