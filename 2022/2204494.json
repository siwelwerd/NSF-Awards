The conference will provide a forum to discuss the state-of-the-art research into the synthesis, properties, and applications of metal halide perovskites. The unique format of a Gordon Research Conference will provide an opportunity to address evolving challenges that are critical to current and future research efforts. The impact will be extended beyond scientific or technological advancement to human resource development. The conference will provide young and early career researchers travel support to participate in the meeting, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nMetal-halide perovskites are a promising class of materials that first exhibited outstanding performance in solar cells and have since shown promise for a range of applications, such as light-emitting diodes and radiation detectors. Metal-halide compounds have significant interest to fundamental materials research, including the type of chemical bonds, formation of crystal lattices, and charge transport dynamics. This Gordon Research Conference will provide an interdisciplinary platform for researchers with a broad spectrum of expertise to share timely research progress on semiconductor physics, chemistry and materials science, as well as novel applications inspired and enabled by emerging semiconductors. In addition to the oral presentations, poster sessions will provide a forum for those attending to present their work to a community of peers and experts and facilitate vibrant discussions. This Gordon Research Conference will provide an interdisciplinary platform for researchers with a broad spectrum of expertise to share timely research progress on semiconductor physics, chemistry and materials science, as well as novel applications inspired and enabled by emerging semiconductors. The unique format of a Gordon Research Conference will provide the opportunity to address evolving challenges that are critical to the current and future research efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
