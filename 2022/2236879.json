 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tunable radio-frequency/microwave signal-processing devices, such as filters, resonators, phase-shifters, are widely used in modern communication systems. With the advent of novel applications related to 5G, new technologies are being developed so that devices can be tuned broadly across multiple frequency channels. Conventionally, magnetic fields are used for tuning such devices. However, they are bulky, slow, and consume lot of power. Thus, there is a critical need for performance improvement of such frequency tunable devices. This NSF project is aimed to develop and test electrically tunable film based high frequency devices that can be rapidly tuned in limited power budget. Objectives of this project are to develop magnetoelectrics multiferroics (ME MFs) composite films based electrically tunable high-frequency devices with large figure of merit (=tunability/insertion-losses) and power-efficiency. Such composite films consists of magnetic and ferroelectric materials and can be tuned electrically and magnetically due to ME coupling. The intellectual merit of the project primarily includes: (i) gaining comprehensive understanding on role of distribution and ratio of magnetic and ferroelectric phases in the composite films to achieve large ME coupling as well as (ii) fabricating and testing ME film based resonators and filters at higher frequencies. The project will bring transformative change as electric voltages are readily available on circuits and the proposed devices are expected to exhibit large figure of merit and allow easy integration with the existing semiconductor technology. Anticipated impacts of this project include training of diverse groups of students in the field of engineering and testing of voltage tunable devices in collaboration with the Oakland University. Minority graduate students will be recruited for this research project. Underrepresented undergraduate students will gain research experience in PI\u2019s lab through McNair Scholar Program. Summer opportunities will be provided to local high-school teachers to learn and develop educational demo kits for high school students based on tunable devices. \r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of this project is to engineer magnetoelectric multiferroic nanocomposite and heterostructured films for developing electrically tunable high-frequency coplanar waveguide resonators and filters with high figure of merit. This project work includes: (i) fabrication of ferroelectric and magnetostrictive composite and heterostructured films with various distribution and ratio of the two phases, (ii) measurement and analysis of the ferroelectric properties and leakage currents, (iii) ME coupling measurements, and (iv) fabrication as well as testing of resonators and filters based on optimized films with high figure of merit. This work will contribute significantly by providing great opportunities for developing power-efficient, compact, high-frequency multi-band voltage tunable devices over 2-12 GHz with large figure of merit that can be integrated with the existing semiconductor technology. The fundamental understanding gained through this project can be expanded to other high-frequency devices, such as phase shifters, oscillators, memory devices, magnetic sensors, and antennas. The educational goal of the project is to train and prepare future generation of engineers in modern multifunctional device technology. The outreach activities will provide training, knowledge, and research exposure to a diverse group of students and high school teachers in this interdisciplinary research area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
