 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computing and quantum information science and engineering is one of the most critical and emerging worldwide technological fields.  The importance of both the quantum research endeavors and the equally important training of a quantum-ready workforce were stressed in the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2019.  This workshop brings together researchers and administrators from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) states and territories to identify how their institutions can better contribute to field of quantum computing and quantum information science and engineering.  The workshop involves attendees learning about the current state of select quantum computing and quantum information science and engineering topics. The workshop has two main Intellectual Merit goals. First, it seeks to provide a platform for collaborative research. Also, the workshop aims to act as a litmus test to determine the state of affairs related to quantum computing and quantum information science and engineering within the EPSCoR states and jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this workshop is to facilitate academic institutions to better understand why they should and examples of how they might contribute to the education of their undergraduate and graduate students for entry into the quantum ready workforce.  This workshop will directly impact over 50 attendees.  By learning about other quantum researchers and institutions, it is expected that organically new and stronger collaborations will emerge to realize the vision of the National Quantum Initiative Act and the vision of the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. The tangible outcome of the workshop in the form of a publicly available report will on its own have potential to have an enormous impact not only on the current quantum computing and quantum information science and engineering researchers but also on the next generation of researchers that look for guidance and reassurances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe workshop was held on March 23-24, 2023 (at the National Science Foundation (NSF), to foster collaboration and assess the state of quantum computing, information science, and engineering (qCISE) within the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This workshop aimed to drive progress in qCISE research and prepare a quantum-ready workforce.\n\n\nFive breakout sessions over two days focused on specific areas:\n\n\n\n\nEPSCoR Capabilities, Challenges, and Opportunities: Participants identified challenges like limited resources and grant competitiveness, and suggested solutions such as regional support networks, shared infrastructure, and standardized curricula.\n\n\n\n\nNISQ Hardware Enablement: Discussions centered on the limited availability and high cost of quantum computers. Recommendations included a national quantum computing facility and affordable educational devices.\n\n\n\n\nApplication Enablement: This session explored the potential of quantum technologies in various industries. Challenges included cost, the need for fault-tolerant quantum computers, and industry collaboration. Promising applications like quantum AI and sensing were highlighted.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Software: The potential of quantum software to revolutionize classical computing was explored. Challenges included bridging the gap between classical and quantum software, identifying real-world applications, and addressing research and infrastructure needs.\n\n\n\n\nCurricula: The focus was on developing a quantum-ready workforce. Challenges included creating sustainable curricula, sharing resources, and funding hardware. Recommendations included collaboration between universities, resource sharing, and outreach programs.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the breakout sessions the following panels were also part of the workshop: academic panel; industrial panel; and gvernmental panel. The participants engaged in a robust discussions on how collectively we can all ensure that the U.S. leadership in qCISE is maintahined.\n\n\nThe workshop served as a crucial platform for identifying challenges and opportunities in the quantum field. By fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange, it laid the groundwork for advancing qCISE research, developing a skilled workforce, and realizing the potential of quantum technologies.
