 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. The University of Louisville is acquiring an upgraded X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer to support the research of Professor Craig Grapperhaus along with colleague Xiang Zhang. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, physical chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. An EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on electronic structure and intermolecular interactions by detecting paramagnetic species. Lifetimes of free radicals, which are short-lived, highly reactive species, and transition metal ions can be identified and quantified in a variety of materials. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in multiple departments within the University of Louisville and at two primarily undergraduate institutions, Indiana University Southeast and Bellarmine University.\r\n\r\nThe award of the EPR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as carbon-free fuels, electronic and spintronic materials, pharmacological applications, and cellular stress caused by diabetes. Specifically, the instrument enables a wide range of projects including electrocatalysts with redox active ligands for small molecule activation and studies of water-soluble catalysts for green organic synthesis. Other investigations include structural biology studies of higher order DNA that is essential for cell life cycles and transcription regulation elements in gene promotor regions. It also assists in the fundamental investigations of a mitochondrial membrane protein that exhibits catalytic activity and the study of reactive oxygen species inducing cell processes. Additionally, it enables the characterization of the magnetic properties of 2D magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
