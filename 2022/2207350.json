 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of populations underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. The Iowa-Illinois-Nebraska STEM Partnership for Innovation in Research and Education LSAMP (IINSPIRE) program was established in 2011 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce. The 16 two-year and four-year colleges and universities that make up the Alliance are diverse and include 10 four-year institutions, five community colleges, and one tribal college. The institutions are Augustana College, Des Moines Area Community College, Doane University, Eastern Iowa Community College District, Grinnell College, Hawkeye Community College, Iowa State University, Iowa Valley Community College District, Kirkwood Community College, Little Priest Tribal College, Luther College, Nebraska Wesleyan University, University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa, Upper Iowa University, and Wartburg College. The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of STEM baccalaureate degrees awarded annually, and increase the community college transfer enrollment, and to enroll a cohort of Alliance students in STEM graduate programs. These goals will be accomplished by continuing successful programming from previous years and by expanding the campus-specific student experience model, in which each campus customizes a general model based on their own needs and contexts. The models include various high-impact practices, including undergraduate research experiences. This approach enables campus leaders to share effective practices and learn from one another. It is central to supporting institutionalization and sustainability in different academic environments. These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe Alliance's broadening participation research is guided by two questions: (1) How does participation in IINSPIRE LSAMP mediate students\u2019 goals over time? (2) How does the IINSPIRE LSAMP alliance create an intentional network to broaden the participation of racially and ethnically minoritized students across STEM fields? A blended theoretical framework drawing on community cultural wealth, intersectionality, and social cognitive career theory facilitates studying both individual student experiences and contextual factors. This research is also investigating how alliance institutions engage students in STEM fields, including newer, emergent fields, such as artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, and quantum science and technology. Preparation and partnerships in these fields is a broader impact of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
