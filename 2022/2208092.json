 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an accelerated growing platform for the efficient production of high-quality tea.  Camellia sinensis, the plant from which tea is extracted, is an evergreen woody plant.  It takes approximately 2 years to propagate liners from mother stock and an additional 5 years of field growth before reaching a steady production potential of approximately 0.5 lbs dried tea per plant per year.  It costs ~$100K/acre to establish a 3,600-plant density, not including land costs. The proposed technology has the potential to reduce the time to harvest from 7 years to 6 months, it may be rapidly scaled, and the chemical profile of the leaf grown is tunable through specific nutrient applications.  In addition, the technology may be used to produce novel tea products for consumers.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of platform technology to accelerate tea plant growth that, in conjunction with proprietary nutrient solutions, reduce the time to tea harvest from years to weeks.  In addition, the health and sensory attributes of the tea leaf produced in the proposed technology are tunable to desired qualities and consumer preferences.  The technology may be easily adopted by farmers wishing to diversify their crops.  The proposed technology system is especially well suited for growing tea in automated controlled indoor environments.  Indoor production of tea may have a commercial advantage compared to existing tea production approaches because the chemical content of the leaf may be controlled by nutrient application and limited exposure to microbes and pathogens.  Combining the rapid growth platform with tuning of sensory and health attributes offers enormous tea marketing potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere has been little innovation in the growth of tea since it became a global industry in the 17th century.  It is a land and labor-intensive operation that is not sustainable.  While China and India are major growers and consumers of tea, Argentina and Kenya have become tea growing hubs of tea export.  Considering global tea consumption, the current economic model of growing tea in countries where labor costs are low and exporting to countries where consumption prices are high is not sustainable.  The carbon footprint of shipping tea from Argentina to Europe where it is packaged and then exported again to the US where it is consumed will become prohibitive.  Moreover, labor costs in traditional tea growing countries are increasing. Tea, being the most consumed beverage in the world and a multi-billion dollar import business for the US, is an industry in need of innovation.  Sustainable growing platforms that minimize nutrient waste through synergistic plant and microbial biochemistries offers solutions to enabling a sustainable tea industry in the 21st century.\n\n \n\nThe ICORPS program enhanced the entrepreneurial training of an NSF funded postdoctoral trainee as well as the PI and explore the possibility of translating fundamental scientific discoveries into products that enhance the lives of consumers.  If viable commercialization strategies emerge from the training we have acquired through the ICORPS program, there is opportunity for workforce development\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacquelyn Gervay-Hague"
