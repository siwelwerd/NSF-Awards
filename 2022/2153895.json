 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the fifteenth edition of the \"Mathematical Results in Quantum Physics\" (QMATH) conference, to take place at the University of California-Davis in September 2022. QMATH is the largest international conference on the mathematical theory of quantum physics and occurs once in three years. Conference attendees will have unique opportunities to participate in a cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas between the mathematical physics, quantum information and theoretical physics communities. The award will support the participation of junior researchers from US institutions, members from underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences, and participants who have no other federal support. By supporting broad participation of junior US based researchers in this event, the project aims to (1) accelerate progress in the mathematical foundations and techniques of emerging new directions in quantum science and technology, (2) attract young talent to this exciting endeavor, and (3) better equip them for successful research in this area. In this way, this project will contribute to realizing the 'The Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution', one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. \r\n\r\nThe broad aim of the QMATH conference is discussion of recent mathematical results in quantum physics. The conference will feature plenary talks and six sessions: Spectral Theory, Quantum Information, Many-body Quantum Physics, Semiclassical Approximation and Dynamical Systems, Disordered systems and random matrices, New Topics in Mathematical Physics. The session 'New Topics in Mathematical Physics' will focus on novel mathematical problems emerging from cutting edge physics. The session 'Quantum Information' aims to facilitate connections between the mathematical physics and quantum information communities. For more information about the conference, see https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~qmath/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
