 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to study the impact of environmental change on small-scale society in the far north during the Ice Age. Archaeology is particularly well positioned to provide relevant insight because it can trace past human behavioral responses to environmental change over long periods of time, including centuries and millennia. Within this broader context, the project will answer important research questions regarding the timing and process of initial dispersal of modern humans to the Bering Land Bridge and the peopling of the Americas. To date, not much is known regarding the earliest archaeology in this critical region. This research will shed light on how northern hunter-gatherers settled and adapted to an ever-changing northern ecosystem. The project will also enhance the education of both graduate and undergraduate students and provide important field and lab research opportunities for them as well. Additionally it will give a young female scientist, member of an underrepresented group in American Paleoindian studies, the opportunity to manage a large research team.\r\n\r\nDr. Kelly Graf of Texas A&M University together with colleagues in the US, Canada, Great Britain and France will examine when and how humans first arrived in North American Beringia, how they settled the region, and how they responded to changing climate from the Ice Age to the recent. Research will be conducted at the multicomponent archaeological site of McDonald Creek, located in the flats of the Tanana river valley in central Alaska, an area not well understood and geographically positioned to have provided a habitable place throughout the late glacial period. Deposits at McDonald Creek are well preserved so the site's rich assemblages will yield a plethora of opportunities for specialized analyses. A combination of specialized molecular and micro-level techniques will be applied to the study of sediment, lithic artifacts, osseous artifacts, fauna and flora. Graf will lead the team of archaeologists, dating specialists, paleoecologists, and geneticists to illuminate the region's changing cultural, ecological and land use history from initial colonization through more recent occupation. This interdisciplinary team will generate new comparative methods for the study of hunter-gatherers in northern contexts, first Americans studies, and Alaskan prehistory.",

We radiocarbon dated 67 samples from 13 concentrated activity areas: seven in component 1, two in component 2a, three in component 2b, and one in component 3. Component 1 dates to 13,800 years ago, component 2a dates to 13,000 years ago, and component 2b dates to 12,700 years ago; therefore, all three occupation phases occurred at the end of the Ice Age when landscape was drier and far more open than today with low herbaceous vegetation and now-extinct animals (e.g., woolly mammoth, steppe bison). In contrast, the component 3 occupation dates from about 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and took place when climatic conditions were more like today with boreal forest animals and vegetation dominating inhabitants&rsquo; surroundings.</span></p>\n<p>Component I contains the largest number of artifacts, faunal remains, charcoal, and concentrated activity areas. Collected materials number nearly 90,000 pieces. Component 1 contains ~79,000 pieces with 85% representing artifacts, 13.5% animal bones, and the remainder charcoal and red pigment pieces. Because materials are so numerous, component 1 analyses are on-going, and exact numbers are yet unknown. Currently, component 1 has 51 identified tools: 38 made on stone, seven bone/ivory points, and six bone needles. Component 1 activity areas preserve 11 features, including a dwelling area with associated post mold, storage pit, and centralized hearth; two additional hearths; bone discard pile; mineral pigment feature; and three stone-tool-making workshops. Component 2a archaeological items number 1,720 with 1,234 stone artifacts (seven tools), 280 animal bones, 205 charcoal pieces, and one red pigment piece. Two hearth features were recorded. Component 2b totaled 9,096 with 8,498 stone artifacts, including 35 tools, 472 animal bones, 99 charcoal pieces, and 27 pigment pieces. Three hearth features were recorded.

We are currently modeling &ldquo;least cost&rdquo; paths from site to source to consider actual pathways traveled. By comparison, component 3 procurement was focused on non-local obsidian and chert with both making up about 62% of raw materials used at the site 6,000-4,000 years ago.
