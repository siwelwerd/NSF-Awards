 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving inductive reasoning skills of undergraduate polymer science students through developing novel, dynamic, evidence-based \"open virtual experiment simulator education tools\" (OVESET) and research-supported materials. Inductive reasoning is the key to success in polymer science learning. This project will offer free, interactive, state-of-the-art learning tools and instructional materials, thus lifting major barriers many students experience when advancing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Specifically, OVESET will allow students to generate experimental results in seconds using only a web browser. Instructors will benefit from both OVESET and the high-quality, evidence-based instructional materials. The products developed in this project will be designed to strengthen students' metacognition, increase students' perceived classroom equity climate, and improve STEM retention.\r\n \r\nSpecifically, this project aims to 1) develop the codes and structure of OVESET for each topic recommended by the American Chemical Society (ACS) for undergraduate polymer science education, 2) create OVESET ancillary materials based on research-supported pedagogy, 3) implement OVESET and ancillary materials in undergraduate polymer science courses and evaluate their effectiveness, and 4) conduct research to understand in what ways OVESET changes students' inductive reasoning and meta-cognition using both quasi-experimental and experimental designs. Systematic evaluation of the project will generate knowledge on whether OVESET advances students' outcomes, STEM retention, and perceived classroom equity. Research studies will generate knowledge on the specific conditions in which OVESET works, such as how interactive virtual simulators like OVESET may impact students' self-efficacy, growth mindset, sense of belonging in STEM, and academic motivation. The NSF IUSE:EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
