 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by preparing secondary school teachers to expose students to the field of engineering.  Nationally, less than fifty percent of the students who enroll in engineering disciplines complete the program. Most of these students drop out of their engineering programs during the first two years, and there is no indication that this trend will slow down in the near future. This project addresses this downward trend by focusing on preparing engineers to be K-12 teachers who will expose students to engineering concepts and designs from an early age. Having engineers in the K-12 classroom should allow children to learn math, physical science, engineering and technology concepts and principles in ways that allow them to connect \u201cabstract ideas\u201d to the world in which they live and with what they desire to learn. Researchers have identified this approach as an effective way to address the challenges and continually growing need for a skilled Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. This project hopes to produce highly trained engineers to teach in secondary school classrooms. The broader impact of this project is the development of teachers who are innovative, pedagogically trained, and qualified engineers who place a high priority on hands-on learning and student engagement. These teachers will be better equipped to assist in laying the foundation in the preparation of the next generation of the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this project is to train STEM preservice teachers to effectively utilize inquiry-based and project-based learning in the secondary (middle and high school) classroom. The project will pilot a set of evidence-based interventions to promote innovation and novel engineering hands-on activities to accomplish this objective. These interventions are (i) applied research training, (ii) professional development training program in engineering design and makerspaces, (iii) intensive student engagement in engineering design projects, (iv) mentoring support, and (v) a set of well-structured early field teaching experiences. These interventions will be integrated and offered to students as research experience credit.  This intervention plan will serve as a model for developing preservice STEM teachers trained in engineering/engineering technology. Pedagogical training should enable these preservice teachers to translate complex theory into age-appropriate hands-on learning activities, such as robot building. The participants of this project will be knowledgeable in inquiry-based learning and how to apply it to be an effective teacher in the 21st century STEM classroom. This project hopes to generate knowledge that will shed light on the factors that contribute to the development of preservice teachers\u2019 self-efficacies in integrating new technology into pedagogical practice. The findings will contribute to the body of knowledge in preservice STEM teacher preparation programs by identifying and assessing a set of pedagogical and professional training activities that produce effective STEM teachers. Materials developed and lessons learned will influence the adoption of similar programs nationwide. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. Partial funding for the project is from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
