 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3-year REU project at the University of Texas-Dallas provides on-site research experiences for undergraduates that contribute toward the U.S. reaching its strategic goal of achieving 35% contribution of wind energy systems to the electricity grid by 2050. Ten participants each year will contribute to research in wind-energy technical thrust areas, including modeling & measurements, diagnostic & control systems, and design & manufacturing. The combination of research and professional development activities aims to stimulate the pursuit of life-long learning and interest in advancing the science of renewable energy. Activities to enhance the engineering workforce are central to the project.  \r\n\r\nThe technical goals and scope of the University of Texas-Dallas REU project comprise three wind-energy thrust areas: 1) Modeling & Measurements: simulation for power production, power fluctuations, and loads; experimental measurements for wind farm performance diagnostic and model validation; wind resource characterization. 2) Diagnostic & Control Systems: condition monitoring for wind turbine systems; optimization of energy capture and load mitigation in wind turbines and wind farms; wind farm controls for wake management. 3) Design & Manufacturing: next generation wind blade designs, manufacturing and testing methods, additive manufacturing of wind turbine components. Undergraduate students will engage in a variety of projects that lead to a greater understanding of wind energy systems and their competitive design. This includes seeking to uncover the impact of turbulence and wake dynamics on power production and fluctuations, developing novel control algorithms to increase the capture of energy while mitigating structural loads, and discovering new diagnostic methods based on physics-based modeling and deep-learning algorithms to determine the health status of wind turbine components as well as operating strategies to increase their lifetime. In addition, students will explore novel materials and methods that can potentially be adopted to fabricate wind turbine blades and towers at reduced costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
