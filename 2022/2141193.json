 "awd_abstract_narration": "Replacement of aging equipment that has served well beyond its expected lifetime is to be acquired by the investigator.  The equipment performs direct real-time observations of nano- and micro-particle (colloid) transport near surfaces, and their attachment to surfaces.  We care about colloid transport near surfaces because it governs their transport distance in porous media in contexts ranging from protecting groundwater resources from pathogens to delivery of novel engineered nanoparticles for subsurface cleanup of hazardous waste.  Despite its importance in a range of contexts, our current ability to predict colloid transport distances in environmental porous media is poor, due to the fact that, under environmental conditions, particles and surfaces tend to repel one another as both tend to be negatively charged.  Colloid-surface repulsion hinders particle attachment to surfaces (unfavorable attachment condition), except at locations where nanoscale charge heterogeneity on surfaces locally eliminates repulsion.  The replacement equipment will allow us to determine the properties of nanoscale charge heterogeneity on surfaces by allowing us to perform arrays of colloid transport experiments by changing physical parameters such as solution velocity, colloid size, and colloid density, as well as chemical parameters such as solution pH, solution ionic strength, and surface mineralogy and composition.  The equipment being replaced has supported five NSF-funded collaborative research projects, training of two post-doctoral and nine graduate student researchers, and dissemination of new knowledge and theory via more than thirty publications, and colloid transport freeware for utilization by researchers and practitioners (Parti-Suite).  The new equipment will allow the investigator to continue to educate graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, and contribute to new knowledge through research, publication, and provision of freeware.\r\n\r\nThe system includes a flow chamber placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope, with a high-resolution camera, and a microfluidic flow system for precise pulse-free flow.  The existing equipment will support currently-funded research by the P.I. and his Ph.D. advisee, as well as a collaborating PI and two of his Ph.D. advisees, as well as anticipated future collaborative awards.  Leveraged transport experiments and mechanistic simulations elucidate how sizes and spatial densities of nanoscale attractive domains on surfaces result in the development of fast- and slow-attaching colloid subpopulations in a population of otherwise identical individuals.  Segregation of otherwise identical colloids into fast- and slow-attaching subpopulations is thought to cause an ubiquitously-observed deviation from the conventionally-expected exponential decreases in colloid concentration with increasing distance from source.  Ongoing investigations will explore the intersecting roles of incomplete pore-scale mixing and colloid-surface repulson on the interactions of colloids with surfaces under unfavorable conditions.  The equipment grant will also provide a platform for outreach efforts in the Secondary School Science Teaching (MSSST) graduate program at the University of Utah, which engages middle and high school biology, chemistry, and earth science teachers in six-week long summer internships that culminate in a teacher-developed series of grade-appropriate lesson plans through which teachers will impact over 600 students.  This outreach to middle and high school students will be conducted by six teachers-in training in summer 2023.  Simulation capabilities will be expanded and provided to the public via Parti-Suite freeware. This freeware consists of five modules for simulations of particle transport and surface interaction.  All modules utilize a graphical user interface for data input and simulation output, although all data and simulations are also output as text and Excel files.  Dr. Johnson will continue to assist researchers in adoption of the freeware via in-person workshops and Zoom-based instruction.  The source codes will be made available to users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A first year Ph.D. student trained on the system, and he is obtaining unprecedented results that are shifting the paradigm to allow a new framework for prediction. He is poised to submit a manuscript this fall (2024). The equipment will support the Ph.D. student through his training and development. We anticipate at least three additional manuscripts describing work that will be performed using the equipment over the next several years. In addition to research, broader impacts of the project include teacher training. Six high school and middle school teachers training in the Masters in Secondary School Science Teaching program at the University of Utah received stipends from the project to support their culminating summer research experience. The culminating experiences were the final step in attaining their M.S. degrees and concerned contaminants in Great Salt Lake. In these experiences, the teachers developed teaching modules, collected samples, performed geochemical analyses, and interpreted and synthesized data to further educate students in their classrooms.  \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamPJohnson\n"
