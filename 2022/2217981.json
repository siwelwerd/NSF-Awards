 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the attendance of many early career and female scientists at the Molecular Basis of Microbial One Carbon Metabolism Conference. The conference will be held in Waterville Valley, New Hampshire August 7-12 of 2022. The conference aims to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary research by bringing engineers and life science researchers together at the same venue.  The conference is designed to be highly interactive, with talks, poster sessions, panel discussions and informal meetings. The scientific focus of the conference is microorganisms and microbial communities that metabolize C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and methanol.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will help build a critical understanding of the structural and functional basis of microbial C1 metabolic processes, which are crucial for global carbon cycling. The conference presents a unique opportunity to facilitate intense and productive communication between researchers from multiple disciplines, all sharing a common interest in the microbial metabolism of C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and methanol.  A focus will be placed on the training and inclusion of the next generation of scientists and providing opportunities for female researchers in the field of microbial C1 metabolism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
