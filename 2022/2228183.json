 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to plan and organize the 2022 National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigator (PI) Meeting. This meeting convenes all PIs of the NSF CPS Program for the 13 time since the program began. The PI Meeting is to take place during the Fall of 2022 in Alexandria, Virginia. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored CPS researchers, industry representatives, and Federal agency representatives to gather and review new CPS developments, identify new and emerging applications, and to discuss technology gaps and barriers. The program agenda is community-driven and includes presentations (oral and poster) from PIs, reports of past year program activities, and showcase/pitch new CPS innovations and results.  This will be a hybrid PI meeting.  It will include both in-person and virtual elements.  This will be the first CPS PI meeting that includes extensive in-person attendance since the pandemic.  The virtual component of the PI meeting will also enable a larger community of researchers spanning academia, industry, and Government to also participate.\r\n\r\nThe annual PI Meeting serves as the only opportunity where the NSF-funded CPS Principal Investigators meet to share their research, discuss new research opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. Furthermore, the PI meeting is also an opportunity for the academic research community to interact with industry entities and government agencies with vested interest in CPS research and development. The PI Meeting is a forum for sharing ideas across the CPS community. It has played a major role in growing the community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others who have interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or sponsors. The 2022 PI meeting will feature lightning talks from researchers, poster sessions, special topic workshops, demonstrations and keynotes from leaders in the research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
