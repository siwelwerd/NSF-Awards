 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transportation sector is in the midst of a major transition to electric vehicles as automotive manufacturers have launched large electric vehicle development programs. Automotive technician training programs will need to adjust to these changes by providing technical education that focuses on electric vehicle technologies. Students need to learn how to diagnose a new set of problems and how to use equipment and tools to maintain these vehicles. This project will develop a new certificate program in hybrid and electric vehicle technology leading to an associate degree in automotive technology. Technician training will focus on the theory, operation, diagnosis, service, and repair of systems related to the propulsion of electric vehicles. Professional development workshops will be provided for postsecondary educators so that they can upgrade their automotive technology programs. During the workshop, participants will learn about battery technology, electric motors, and safety procedures through classroom instruction and hands-on learning experiences with electric vehicles and service equipment. High school students will have the opportunity to learn about careers in automotive technology through summer camps in which students will learn the hands-on basics of vehicle maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to help develop the technician workforce that can support the new infrastructure for electric vehicles. This project aims to increase the capacity of faculty to prepare automotive technicians to repair and service electric vehicles, the number of automotive technician graduates with the knowledge and skills needed to diagnose and repair electric vehicles, and the number of high school students enrolling in automotive technology degree and certificate programs. Faculty in automotive technology programs at two-year institutions will be recruited to participate in a summer workshop on electric vehicle technologies. Workshop participants will have hands-on learning opportunities focused on diagnostics, testing, and repair procedures. The project will develop a new certificate program that will provide students with advanced training in high-voltage safety systems, removing/replacing batteries, servicing electric drive motors, diagnosing electric power convertors, and other skills needed to service battery electric vehicles. Technician training will focus on the theory, operation, diagnosis, service, and repair of vehicle systems. The project will recruit high school students from traditionally underrepresented groups for automotive summer camps designed to increase students\u2019 interest in taking automotive technician courses. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
