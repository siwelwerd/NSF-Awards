 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to image and control electron dynamics at the atomic scale has led to a deeper understanding of atomic structures and interactions, which in turn has inspired technological advances in areas such as microscopy, quantum computing, and quantum communication.  Many of these advances use ultrashort light pulses or electron beams to control and observe energy and momentum properties of atomic electrons on their natural attosecond timescale (a billionth of a billionth of a second).  Recently, so-called twisted attosecond laser pulses and electron beams have become available. These beams carry orbital angular momentum, which opens the door to controlling not just the energy and momentum properties of atomic electrons, but also their rotational properties.  This research will develop and apply theoretical models for using ultrashort twisted laser pulses and twisted electron beams to image and control the rotational properties of atomic electrons.  It will promote the progress of attosecond physics by developing new techniques for studying twisted electron creation, characterizing the temporal dynamics of previously inaccessible atomic states, and establishing the efficiency of the creation of atomic states used quantum computing applications.  These projects will provide the theoretical underpinning for future experiments and technological developments, demonstrate the advantages of twisted light and electrons in controlling atomic-level rotational motion, and enhance the U.S. influence in attosecond physics.  In addition, the research will train the next generation of the science and technology workforce by providing cutting-edge research opportunities to undergraduate students who will gain necessary career skills through hands-on participation in model development, implementation, and analysis.  Students will present their results at regional and national conferences, giving them a more diverse view of scientific research and enhancing their access to science and technology careers.\r\n\r\nThis research will use computational modeling to (1) develop the new techniques of twisted attosecond energy and angular streaking using Laguerre-Gauss optical vortex pulses and (2) determine if twisted optical and electron wave packets can improve the efficiency of circular Rydberg atom production for use in quantum computing applications.  In the first project, the research will combine optical vortex wave packets with attosecond streaking techniques to study the effects of angular momentum on the creation of twisted photoelectrons, the ionization time delay between magnetic sublevels, and the tunneling barriers of different angular momentum states.  Calculations will be performed using the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and semi-classical models to provide both quantitative and qualitative insight.  This research will result in theoretical models that outline new twisted attosecond streaking techniques and will have far-reaching implications for fundamental quantum mechanics and applications in fields such as chemical reaction control and charge migration in solid state physics.  In the second project, the efficiency with which twisted photons and electrons can be used to create circular Rydberg states will be determined.  The research will result in a comprehensive dataset detailing which Rydberg states are most accessible through twisted wave packet excitation and provide much-needed information for future applications that have the potential to transform fields such as quantum computing and quantum simulation.  Both projects will enhance the Illinois STEM workforce by providing cutting-edge training opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate students from the freshman to senior level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
