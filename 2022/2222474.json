 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to significantly alter the current state of electric propulsion by providing a thruster platform with extended capabilities. Such a change would allow Hall thrusters to span a wider range of operating parameters with added benefits of increased efficiency, lower cost, exploration of deep space, and backup power via a radioisotope power system (RPS). By using a RPS, the thruster platform will produce one watt of electrical power for every nine watts of heating power. The heating power will enable the use of high-density metal propellants such as zinc. The electrical power will provide a backup for solar generation and can potentially power basic satellite systems. This work will provide scientific knowledge regarding nuclear fuel recycling, power generation, and related space technologies. Lastly, this work will be highly collaborative and will contribute to the training of a highly diverse workforce. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses a longstanding issue in space propulsion; the reliance on xenon as a fuel. The primary objective of the proposed work is to produce a prototype Hall Effect thruster utilizing zinc fuel and a RPS unit. A thermal management system will manage the heat produced by the RPS unit to deliver fuel to the thruster. Initial work will use an electrical module that will act as a placeholder for the RPS unit; the latter can be inserted when necessary. Design of the prototype will follow Hall Effect thruster scaling laws to reduce risk. The results of the tested prototype will provide information on the expelled ions, thruster efficiency, and divergence of the thruster plume. More broadly, the results will provide data on realizing an alternative to xenon fuel for space propulsion as part of an improved thruster platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
