 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) 2022 will be held at the University of Copenhagen from Monday, July 18, to Friday, July 22, 2022. The YTM consists of two major components: three mini-courses by distinguished researchers on the one hand, and a line-up of forty short talks and twenty poster presentations, mostly by graduate students, on the other. Being one of the largest conferences in the world dedicated to early career researchers in the field of Algebraic Topology, the YTM provides a unique opportunity for junior topologists to gain experience giving conference presentations to a wide audience, broaden their horizons by learning about subfields not represented at their institutions, expose their work to the international topology community, and develop collaborations with other early career researchers. Furthermore, the YTM seeks to promote diversity by featuring graduate student speakers from underrepresented groups and from universities that are less well-represented in topology and by providing a friendly and welcoming community for students from all backgrounds. By providing funding for US participants, the NSF is promoting the exchange of scientific ideas between the US and the international topology community, in particular providing a setting for students and other topologists from the US to make research connections and develop relationships with their future international colleagues, as well as supporting a culture of diversity and inclusion. \r\n \r\nThe three mini-courses this year will be on: (1) symplectic homotopy theory by Andrew Blumberg, which will provide an introduction to Floer stable homotopy theory with an eye towards his recent breakthrough with Mohammed Abouzaid on the Arnold conjecture; (2) stratification and descent by Natalia Castellana, revolving around a recent series of papers by her and coauthors on the support-stratifications of module categories over cochains of various spaces of interest in algebraic topology and representation theory; and (3) cellular sheaf theory by Robert Ghrist, which will be a crash course on sheaf theory in applied topology, starting with basic materials on cellular sheaves and moving on to various use-cases in topological data analysis. These mini-courses offer introductions into major subfields of current active research, and serve as a gateway into these fields even for early graduate students. Participant-contributed talks and posters will cover a wide range of topics in topology, spanning across higher algebra, homotopy theory, geometry, and applied topology.  More information can be obtained from the conference website  https://www.math.ku.dk/english/calendar/events/ytm2022/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
