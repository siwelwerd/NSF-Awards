 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Rhodes College is acquiring an upgraded console for a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with a broadband probe to support the research of Professor Larryn Peterson and colleague William R. Eckenhoff. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of organic, bioorganic, and inorganic chemistry.  In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels at Rhodes College as well as provides accessibility for use at LeMoyne-Owen College. This instrument enhances the recruitment and engagement in research and teaching for underrepresented groups at these institutions.   \r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing the research and education at all levels, especially in organic, bioorganic, and inorganic small molecule research. The instrument impacts a variety of research projects including the development of highly active proton reduction catalysts with earth abundant metals and the design and synthesis of dopamine derivatives and other catechols as probes for enzyme function. It also assists with the synthesis, characterization, and biological activity studies of antimicrobial peptides from animal venoms, and the synthesis of novel unnatural amino acids and mutated peptides to determine FNII and CTLD1 domains. Additionally, the instrument facilitates the design of inhibitors of the LpxC enzyme, new methods to oxidize aryl ketones to carboxylic acids, the synthesis of boronic acid analogues of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and the development of course-based undergraduate research experiences for the organic chemistry laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
