 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Florida will organize and support a  two-day conference for representatives of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs in ocean sciences who will map the landscape of programs and opportunities designed to encourage underrepresented students to pursue ocean STEM careers. A primary goal is to identify existing programs in this space, what audience(s) they reach, and where the gaps or connection points are between programs.  A secondary goal of the workshop is to identify ways to provide increased access to at-sea training and experiences, as well as shoreside experiences, especially at the undergraduate level where opportunities are lacking. \r\n\r\nThis conference will support the development of new long-term collaborations focused on supporting the engagement of under-represented students in ocean sciences. The workshop will seek to mitigate barriers to advancement of under-represented students in ocean sciences and to identify pathways that support student advancement in ocean science careers. The results of the workshop will be disseminated in a report, and the PI will seek to publish an information item about the workshop results in a major ocean science journal. The collaborative plan that emerges from it will aid all DE&I programs in ocean science. The workshop report will help existing and new programs, institutions, and individuals interested in advancing DE&I in ocean sciences by identifying best practices, gaps and opportunities, and potential collaborators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
