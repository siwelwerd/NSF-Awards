 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers use two mechanisms to store data: read-only memory (ROM), which can be written but not erased, and random-access memory (RAM), which can be written and erased multiple times. Cells can also be programmed to store high density read-only data by permanently modifying the genetic code, and they have the potential to be used as sustainable data storage components for digital devices. However, it remains challenging to store high density data in cells using RAM-like approaches that allow for multiple write-read-erase cycles. In addition, there are limited methods to read out stored biological information non-disruptively, without affecting cell viability. To overcome these challenges, this project will code information into different biomolecules within cells, including synthetic RNA, which are retained within cells, and redox-active small molecules, which can diffuse in and out of cells. Outside of cells, the mediators will be detected using semiconducting polymers which represent sustainable bio-materials. All of these components will be assembled to build a hybrid biological-semiconductor system with high storage and communication functionalities. This research will train doctoral students pursuing studies in multiple disciplines to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams, and it will educate scholars at community colleges about research and transfer opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to create hybrid cell-material systems capable of high-density data storage in cells (100 bytes) using RNA, with facile read out through the bio-production of redox-active chemical mediators. These systems will be created by programming cells to synthesize mediator components, by using a facile low energy electrochemical read out, and by decoding information from living cells in a manner that minimizes cell fitness burdens and data storage failure rates. Additive manufacturing approaches will be developed to achieve scalable and sustainable biohybrid systems. Two novel forms of biological memory elements will be used to create random-access memory that is capable of repetitive write-read-erase data cycles. First, RNA memory will be created that codes data using a highly designable catalytic RNA. Second, mediator memory will be created that can be read out using a semiconductive polymer outside of cells. The proof-of-concept bioelectronic system will be created using the model microbe Escherichia coli. The modularity of the memory elements will then be evaluated in other gram-negative microbes to establish how portable these approaches are across different cellular chassis.\r\n\r\nThis project has been jointly funded by Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
