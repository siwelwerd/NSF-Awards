 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The University of Texas at El Paso is acquiring an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) to support the research of Professor XiuJun Li and colleagues Carlos Cabrera Martinez, Jorge Gardea-Torresdey, Hongmei Luo, and Sreeprasad Sreenivasan. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, materials science, and physics. XPS spectra are produced by irradiating a sample with X-rays that have sufficient energy to eject electrons. Next, the kinetic energy of the electrons is measured and subsequently related to their binding energy. These data can be related to the chemical elements in the sample and effects from their bonding environment. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments and broadly impacts research in the fields of catalysis, sensing, energy materials, magnetic materials, and additive manufacturing. The instrument is leveraged in many courses including a new course focused on surface analysis. \r\n\r\nThe award for the XPS is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels to explore advanced surface chemistry, new properties of advanced materials and sensors through systematic characterization of elemental, chemical, and structural information by this instrument, thus meeting the research and educational needs of the southwest region. Research focuses on investigations relevant to catalysis, electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, photovoltaic applications. It also assists in studies involving nanostructure catalysts relevant to fuel cells and investigations of novel energy storage materials. Other studies focus on understanding structural and compositional impacts on doped graphene quantum dots for electrocatalysis, sensing and quantum science; nanoparticle transport in plant structures; 3D printed non-oxide ceramics; and magnetic nanoparticles for nanoelectronics, data storage devices and quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
