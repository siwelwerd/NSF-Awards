 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light-matter interaction is a core subject in physics and its applications.  The specific case of the interaction of a single atom with an intense (or \"strong\") electromagnetic field has driven a huge amount of research in atomic, molecular, and optical physics.  Furthermore, it has powerful applications to other areas of physics and technology.  This broad and deep impact was recognized with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics.  The continued expansion of experimental regimes for strong field interactions, for table-top experiments as well as major facilities like X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) recently constructed worldwide, has huge long-term potential just beginning to be realized today. For instance, vortex beams have applications to optical communication and imaging, by dynamic control of magnetic properties of materials, and spintronics.  Ultimately, they will allow manipulation of atoms, molecules, and localized manipulation of magnetic properties of solids, the way optical vortices are routinely used in optical tweezers to manipulate cells.  The interdisciplinary nature of this area is ideal not only for applications to technology, but also for training of both undergraduate and graduate students for future careers in academic physics or related ultrafast sciences, in national laboratories and emerging XFEL facilities, or in private industry.  \r\n\r\nUltrafast laser-matter interaction has rapidly expanded into new very promising experimental regimes, where old theoretical assumptions, which already were debatable, clearly break down.  In particular, for beams carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (also known as vortex beams), the widely used dipole approximation is not applicable, adding significant complexity.  The team will develop semiclassical methods to address open problems involving strong field ionization.  This semiclassical approach will treat the initial ionization step quantum mechanically, followed by classical propagation of electron trajectories in the continuum, with final results directly comparable to experimental data.  The theory will first be tested in well-known experimental regimes of non-adiabatic strong field ionization with infrared light, where it will also be used to resolve outstanding debate about which theoretical description of wavepacket post-ionization is valid.  Properly developed theory here will then address some of the high profile dispute about ionization delays and tunelling time.  Likewise, a new theory for vortex beams, along with a semi-classical framework, will be very impactful.  For strong field interactions with vortex beams, the theory would suggest a first proof-of-principle experiment.  Applications include controlling magnetic, topological, and quantum excitations on the attosecond time and nanometer length scales and time-resolved electron diffraction experiments with twisted electrons.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
