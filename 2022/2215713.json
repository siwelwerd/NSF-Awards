 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary\r\n\r\nScientists at Norfolk State University (NSU) work on developing novel materials and nanostructures where quantum physics plays a significant role producing unusual magnetic, electric, and optical properties not found in common materials. These unique properties are related to the quantum behavior of electrons and interactions between them at the atomic scale. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will purchase an electron spin resonance spectrometer, which allows one to get information on individual unpaired electrons and electron assemblies, characterize magnetic properties of materials, and explore possibilities for manipulation of electrons with light. The materials and systems that are being developed can revolutionize future technology, contribute to energy technology with new photosensitive materials, and accelerate Information processing to optical speeds of operation (orders of magnitude faster than now).  In addition, the electron spin resonance instrumentation is important for the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups (many of whom are first-generation college or graduate students) by involving them in cutting-edge research and providing hands-on experience on advanced scientific equipment. Furthermore, the instrument serves as a multi-user facility supporting STEM research at NSU and other local schools. \r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\n\r\nElectron magnetic resonance methods provide an important information on unpaired electron spins, their interactions and dynamics, and allow one to characterize magnetic phases of magnetic materials, and the presence of defects and valence states of impurities in diamagnetic systems. The new EMXplus EPR Spectrometer is a vital characterization equipment for materials science and is involved in several research directions in the Center for Materials Research of Norfolk State University, which include: (i) quantum materials, which demonstrate unusual magnetism and interplay between magnetic and charge transport degrees of freedom associated with chiral topology; (ii) nanostructured systems with coupling of plasmonic, magnetic and electric effects; (iii) transition from quantum to classical behavior in supermaramagnetic nanoparticles; and (iv) effects of light illumination and spin-dependent transport in organic systems. The instrumentation will serve as a multi-user facility, and also enrich education, providing hands-on experience in training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups at Norfolk State University, one of the largest HBCUs in the nation, and partner HBCU institutions (Elizabeth City State University and Virginia State University).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
