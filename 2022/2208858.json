 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning proposal looks to enable the engagement of academic researchers and coastal community stakeholders around Alaska. The community  stakeholders include tribal entities, community member harvesters, and mariculture farmers. The team will use the planning process to begin discussions around workforce development and diversity activities to be included in the future EPSCoR Track-1 Glaciers to Gulf (G2G) proposal.  The G2G proposal will address aspects related to: Terrestrial Export, Marine Resources, and Human Dimensions.  The topics are aligned with Alaska's Science and Technology Plan.  The primary desired outcomes from the planning grant activities include: 1) a team science collaboration plan outlining best practices for stakeholder engagement and co-production of research; 2) an assessment of existing strengths and weaknesses with respect to the research themes and jurisdictional capacity (SWOT analysis); 3) an evaluation of the existing gaps in jurisdictional expertise and knowledge (gap analysis); and 4) a draft of a logic model to ensure success of G2G.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
