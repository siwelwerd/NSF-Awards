 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU award to Bowie State University (BSU), located in Bowie, MD, is a 10-week program to train 8 students (24 total) in summers 2022 \u2013 2025. The students are from schools with limited research opportunities and under-represented groups. Research is conducted at Egerton University (EU) in Nakuru, Kenya, Africa. Students learn how research is conducted, and present their results at scientific conferences. Research focuses on genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms underlying crop responses in a changing environment seeking food security. Assessment of the program will be performed using online surveys. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe scientific theme focuses on hidden food treasures of the forgotten, underutilized and ignored food crops, which are highly nutritious with rich reservoirs of genetic diversity that can fit well into existing agricultural systems. This Program contributes to the national need of training a global workforce. The program is hosted by BSU\u2019s Department of Natural Sciences and Egerton University, Department of Crops, Horticulture and Soils.  Students\u2019 first week is at BSU for an intensive boot camp on the history and culture of Kenya, safety, ethics/responsible conduct of research, basic scientific principles and skills to prepare for the research project. The next 8 weeks involve research at EU, followed by a closing symposium where students present research results. Student projects include: characterization of Rhizobia; Dolichos lablab accessions; Climate Smart approaches for promotion and adoption of Arid and semi-Arid Sorghum; Indigenous Vegetable Project: A focus on Cassava; Analysis of multi-environment adaptation and its effect on nutrient profiles of finger millet genotypes (Eleusine coracana L. Gaertn); Diversity of endophytes in Kenyan forgotten food crops. Virtual Metabolomic workshops are offered by the USA team. Students learn literature review, experimental techniques and design, data collection and analysis as well as professional development. Recruitment and participant selection focus on students with outstanding research potential from underrepresented groups. Application forms are available on the BSU REU Program website as downloadable electronic files. Applications will be evaluated by a Selection Committee. More information is available by visiting https://www.bowiestate.edu/academics-research/colleges/college-arts-sciences/departments/natural-sciences/research-experience-for-underg/, or by contacting the PI, Dr. Anne Osano at aosano@bowiestate.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
