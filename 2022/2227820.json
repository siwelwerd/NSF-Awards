 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the 2022 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Genome Instability (July 9-10, 2022 in Ventura Beach, CA). The GRS will be held just prior to the associated Gordon Research Conference (GRC; July 10-15, 2022). These two meetings bring together young and established scientists from multiple disciplines who are addressing a broad range of questions about DNA repair and genome maintenance, from tool development to mechanism and function. The GRS, in particular, enables a diverse group of early career scientists to discuss current research through seminars and poster sessions, exchange new ideas, technologies and resources informally, and develop their professional network. Hence this conference will facilitate training and professional development of the next generation of scientists in this rapidly expanding area, including underrepresented minorities. The GRS program includes a panel discussion on career choices with accomplished scientists in different professions. The GRS also serves as a career development experience for the co-chairs and organizers, who are postdocs. \r\n\r\nGenome maintenance and stability are essential to cellular function, stable inheritance, and organismal phenotype. The intricate monitoring, signaling and, when necessary, repair systems are also important because their dysfunction leads to a wide range of important diseases. The GRS and GRC serve as a vital link for investigators around the world to share their latest, often unpublished discoveries, discuss pioneering ideas and launch new collaborations. Topics at the forefront of biochemistry, molecular genetics and cell biology of DNA repair pathways will be covered, among others.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
