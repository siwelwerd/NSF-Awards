 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rare Earth elements (REEs) are a group of heavy elements that are critical to modern energy technologies and efficiency such as batteries for electric cars, energy efficient lighting, display panels, and magnets for wind turbines. However, they are energy intensive and environmentally damaging to mine and purify; and mining, in particular, could disproportionally impact disadvantaged communities. In recent years domestic production of REEs has declined to negligible levels making the US dependent on imports from other countries with important implications for energy and national security. The goal of this research is to create 3D printed assemblies of encapsulated, engineered bacteria that will be able to selectively extract REEs from ores and industrial waste products, such as coal fly ash, in an environmentally friendly way. These assemblies of printed, encapsulated bacteria will be integrated into membrane bioreactors where REEs can be easily collected with the help of separation membranes. In addition to conducting laboratory research to optimize different components in this living system, the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed approach and its social, health, environmental, and economic implications for mining communities will be evaluated. Additional benefits to society will be accomplished through education and training including the mentoring of four graduate students at the University of Texas, Austin.\r\n\r\nRare earth elements (REEs) can help reduce worldwide dependence on fossil fuels and are necessary for many modern technologies. Current REE extraction methods are resource intensive, environmentally damaging, and in some cases disproportionally impact disadvantaged communities. Biologically promoted leaching and separation of REEs is a promising option but remains challenging due to fundamental knowledge gaps that limit selectivity, throughput, and scalability. The overall goal of this research is to engineer a living system via high-throughput printing of bioreactor droplets into functionally organized, selectively permeable structures capable of producing biological reductants and lanmodulin-type proteins to extract and concentrate REEs from low grade ores or waste streams that can then be separated for collection in membrane bioreactors. The specific research objectives are to: 1) develop microbial cultures that produce biomolecules for enhanced REE extraction and separation, 2) develop smart biological droplet architectures that enhance lanthanide transport and concentration, 3) develop a high-throughput printing method for functionally-structured, bacteria-encased droplets, and 4) integrate the desired bioreactor droplet structures into a membrane bioreactor for sustainable REE recovery and evaluate the process. The evaluation includes assessment of the ethical, social, economic, health, legal, safety, and environmental implications of replacing current REE extraction technologies with the proposed bioreactor droplet system. The successful completion of this research could have transformative impacts on REE extraction by providing domestic, sustainable, and reliable sources. New research knowledge will be incorporated into college courses, undergraduate students will be involved in research and K-12 outreach, and educational materials for REE-impacted communities will be created. The included broadening participation plan promotes retention through novel mentoring, motivates students through civic engagement, and prepares students through multidisciplinary research and coursework.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
