 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will make it possible for 26 graduate students, 10 postdocs, and 7 plenary speakers from underrepresented groups to attend the 8th triennial conference on the Foundations of Molecular Modeling and Simulation (FOMMS 2022) to be held in Delavan, WI on July 17-21, 2022. Molecular-level modeling and simulation are ubiquitous tools for advancing science and engineering in applications ranging from the design of new materials to understanding how drug molecules interact with protein receptors in the body. The FOMMS conference series was initiated in 2000 to foster interaction among academic, national laboratory, and industrial molecular researchers developing and applying molecular-based computational methods. FOMMS 2022 will feature 18 plenary speakers, one keynote speaker, a FOMMS Metal Lecture, workshops with an educational focus, and two poster sessions. With no parallel sessions, the meeting structure is designed to encourage interaction between established and early career researchers and promote mentoring of the latter. The diverse and international selection of invited speakers strikes a balance between industrial and academic researchers.\r\n\r\nThe theme of FOMMS 2022 is \u201cMolecular Modeling and the Data Revolution,\u201d recognizing the increasingly important role of data science within the molecular modeling and simulation community. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, cluster analysis, and advanced visualization techniques now figure prominently in the computationally efficient analysis of the dynamic behavior of molecules in response to their environment and molecular neighbors. Molecular-level modeling is an increasingly powerful tool for predicting the properties of materials and molecular systems and for obtaining insights into their structure/property relationships. These methods find applications in areas ranging from polymers to catalysts to pharmaceuticals. The description of molecular modeling encompasses quantum chemical chemistry, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, meso-scale modeling including field theoretic and particle-based coarse-grained simulations, multiscale simulation methods that bridge ab-initio MD and hybrid QM/MM methods, and the application of these methods for the discovery of molecules using these approaches augmented by AI. These topics will be explored by the 26 graduate students, 10 postdocs, and 7 plenary speakers supported by this grant to attend FOMMS 2022. A diverse slate of speakers from the U.S., Europe, and Asia have been selected to address the challenges and opportunities that currently exist in molecular-level simulations and among them, those researchers supported with this funding will play a crucial role in the success of this meeting. The Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and the Division of Materials Research contributed funds to this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over 130 participants took part in the meeting, with approximately 6% of these from industry, 7% from national labs, and 15% from countries outside the U.S. The conference began with a Sunday afternoon workshop focused on \"HOOMD-blue,\" which was led by Dr. Joshua Anderson and doctoral student Brandon Butler (University of Michigan). After the opening reception on Sunday evening, one of the leading figures in process design, Dr. Claire Adjiman of Imperial College London, gave the opening keynote lecture on \"Engineering molecules: a view from process design.\"</p>\n<p>On Monday, Prof. Scott Shell (University of California Santa Barbara) and Prof. Sapna Sarupria &nbsp;(University of Minnesota) gave presentations in a session focused on \"Energy and Environment.\" The first contributed poster session took place Monday afternoon, featuring 44 posters presented with lively discussion over beverages and light refreshments. The evening session was devoted to \"New Approaches in Computational Catalysis,\" with talks by Prof. Heather Kulik (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Prof. Randall Snurr (Northwestern University).</p>\n<p>The Tuesday morning session featured talks by Prof. Edward Maginn (University of Notre Dame) and Dr. Jose Tabora (Bristol-Myers Squibb) on the topic of \"Product Design.\" Participants took Tuesday afternoon off to enjoy group outings, including a thrilling trip to Zip Line Canopy Adventure, a visit to Yerkes Observatory, and a boat tour of Lake Geneva. Attendees returned for an evening session focused on \"Biological Systems,\" with talks by Prof. Andrew Ferguson (University of Chicago) and Prof. Shikha Nangia (Syracuse University).</p>\n<p>Wednesday began with talks on \"Sustainability\" by Prof. Thomas Truskett (University of Texas at Austin), Prof. Styliani Consta (University of Western Ontario), and Prof. Erich Muller (Imperial College London). The second contributed poster session was held in the afternoon, with 45 posters, refreshments, and robust discussions. The evening session featured presentations related to the subject \"Molecular Modeling Fundamentals,\" with talks by Prof. Fernando Escobedo (Cornell University) and Prof. Michael Shirts (University of Colorado Boulder).</p>\n<p>The final day was a busy one. The morning began with a session on \"Applications of Machine Learning,\" featuring talks by Dr. Rebecca Lindsey (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) and Prof. Bingqing Cheng (IST Austria). Two workshops were held during the afternoon period. One addressed \"The Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF),\" and was led by Prof. Peter Cummings (Vanderbilt University). A second focused on \"signac,\" a framework that aids in the management of large and heterogeneous data spaces, which was led by Corwin Kerr (University of Michigan).</p>\n<p>The final session featured a presentation from the FOMMS Medal recipient, Prof. Doros Theodorou of the National Technical University of Athens, who gave a talk entitled \"Meeting the Challenge of Long Times in Entangled Macromolecules: From Atomistic to Mesoscopic Modeling and Simulations.\" Following this presentation, the traditional FOMMS movie, produced by Prof. Christopher Wilmer (University of Pittsburgh), was screened.</p>\n<p>FOMMS 2022 introduced a new component to the traditional format. Specifically, professional development panels focused on \"Careers in computational molecular science\", \"Supporting inclusive excellence in computational molecular science\", and \"Best practices for publishing in computational molecular science\" were held during the Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday morning sessions. We are grateful to Jim Pfaendtner (University of Washington), Sharon Glotzer (University of Michigan), Edward Maginn (University of Notre Dame), and Michael Shirts (University of Colorado Boulder) for serving as moderators. The panels spurred lively discussion and afforded early career researchers like PhD students and post-doctoral scholars an opportunity to obtain valuable feedback regarding areas important to the computational science community. Feedback related to the new component was very positive.</p>\n<p>Participant survey results suggest that FOMMS 2022 was a great success. Participants commented favorably on the location, the speakers, and the format. Participants were appreciative of the ample time scheduled into the program for informal meetings and interactions as well as the quality of the speakers and poster sessions.</p>\n<p>Support from the National Science Foundation enabled us to grant 25 Early Career Researcher Awards targeted at graduate students and post-doctoral scholars and 12 Plenary Speaker Awards. The awards enabled people to attend the meeting who otherwise might not have been able to do so.
