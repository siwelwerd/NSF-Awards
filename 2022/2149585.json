 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods that have been developed for non-contact magnetic manipulation of objects have typically assumed that those objects comprise a large fraction of ferromagnetic material. Many engineered devices contain no magnetic material but do contain electrically conductive material. This award will support research on dexterous six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) manipulation of non-magnetic, but electrically conductive materials using stationary electromagnetic field sources. Preliminary results indicate that eddy current-induced forces and torques produced in the objects by the magnetic fields can be used to achieve this objective, paving way for an entirely new class of robotic manipulation opportunity. The knowledge gained in this research has the potential to contribute a solution to a major problem facing humanity: orbital space debris. Most space debris is made of aluminum: a conductive but non-magnetic material. There is a dire need for remediation strategies to remove debris already in orbit and to repair or remove human-made objects before they become new debris, to protect the fast-growing number of satellites that the world\u2019s population has grown to rely on. This award will also support training and mentorship of graduate students, inclusion of undergraduate students in research, and outreach to K-12 students through university programs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to test the conjecture that physical modeling and robot-learning techniques can be combined to improve manipulation of conductive non-magnetic objects for which a model exists, and enable manipulation of objects with no prior model, using multiple stationary electromagnetic rotating-dipole-field sources that partially surround the object. The investigation will explore the optimal manipulation of conductive objects for which a model of eddy current-induced force-torque already exists. It will also elucidate a generalized model for eddy current-induced force-torque on conductive spheres of varying size, wall thickness, and material to serve as a first-order approximation for other conductive object geometries. The scope also includes examination of cases where the system lacks a model of the target object and must acquire one online from sensor observations. Finally, experimental validation of the concepts will be performed with the development of a 6-DOF neutral-buoyancy water-based microgravity simulator.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
