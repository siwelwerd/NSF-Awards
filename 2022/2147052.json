 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant supports a research project that examines the impact of increasingly severe storms and rising sea levels on network infrastructures, such as the Internet and other digital communication channels. The research study is located in south Louisiana, where efforts to expand and maintain network connectivity are happening against the backdrop of sea level rise and increased intensity of storms. In particular, the researchers will study how recent federal and state policy initiatives that aim to broaden broadband access  play out in a place shaped by environmental and social inequality. The research aims to connect issues of environmental and digital inequality as a way to understand how to create more equitable and sustainable network infrastructures. \r\n\r\nThe study addresses the following research questions. How and to what extent are histories of extraction and regional infrastructural development reflected in current network infrastructures? How are practices of maintaining and expanding network infrastructures in vulnerable coastal communities shifting to respond to the impact of drastic environmental changes? What are alternative approaches to maintaining and expanding network infrastructures in vulnerable coastal communities? To address these questions, the researchers use historical, ethnographic, and design research methods to understand and map out historical connections between environmental inequality and digital inequality, to understand practices that maintain and develop network infrastructures within vulnerable coastal communities, to develop approaches and practices for STS and computing research scholars that re-envision network infrastructures. The research will contribute to building new understandings of the impact of such changes on network infrastructures among policy makers, computing practitioners, and local communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project examined the practices of maintaining network infrastructures in a time of overlapping social and ecological issues. This study was situated in coastal communities in south Louisiana, where efforts to expand network connectivity and repair existing infrastructures are happening against the backdrop of landscape change tied to land loss and increased frequency of hurricanes. We examine how recent federal and state initiatives that aim to expand Internet infrastructure happen in a region shaped by environmental and social inequality. The ongoing legacy of oil extraction and petrochemical production has led to uneven development and deep socioeconomic disparities in this region, while increased intensity of storms and floods due to climate change have begun to damage existing infrastructures. Our research questions include: 1.) How and to what extent are histories of extraction and regional infrastructural development reflected in current network infrastructures? 2.) How are practices of maintaining network infrastructures shifting to respond to the impact of environmental change? and, 3.) What are alternative approaches to maintaining network infrastructures in coastal communities? We ask these questions as a way to understand relationships between environmental inequality and digital inequality, practices of maintaining network infrastructures in coastal communities, and develop approaches to re-envision network infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, we used ethnographic, historical, and design methods to investigate our research questions. Drawing from historical research, we show the interdependent relation between telecommunications infrastructure and the development of gas and oil extraction industries in south Louisiana. From our ethnographic research, we show how stronger storms and a shifting landscape affect the temporalities of infrastructural restoration work by utility workers by changing how workers anticipate, manage, and repair network disruptions. This work shows the stanchions between fixing things so that they will work well enough for now, and planning ahead for future storms. Drawing on design research activities, we show how co-design methods in developing an emergency based communication network reveals the underlying human and urban infrastructure that facilitates the design of these networks. Overall, our findings show that network infrastructures shape and are shaped by the coastal landscapes they are embedded in through technical, social, political, and ecological relations. Through this lens, network infrastructures stay connected through dynamic, constant, and material processes between ecologies and people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
