 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will organize and host a workshop to identify the parameters and sub-elements for a potential Convergence Accelerator track related to chemical sensing. The core of this effort is to engage and bring together scientists and user communities together to envision how best to leverage the advances in chemical science sensing research, focusing especially on the convergence between areas related to biological olfaction, material science, bioelectronics and manufacturing, genetic engineering, AI/ML/Data Science, to define use inspired approaches that could lead to development of sensors for several applications.  including diagnosis of diseases, homeland security, environmental monitoring. The proposed workshop is expected to help identify pilot efforts for a track in that it can facilitate development of several applications, including diagnosis of diseases, homeland security, environmental monitoring. These insights, if implemented in a track, could have transformative impacts on the translation of scientific research related to olfactory circuits into portable detectors/sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity. \r\n\r\nThis workshop effort plans include online ideation, virtual meetings of stakeholders, and in-person synthesis. A particular focus will be on bringing together researchers and user communities from different segments including climate change and environmental monitoring, homeland security, agriculture. Representatives from different federal agencies as well as industry will also be part of the workshop organizing teams. This will  bring in perspectives from experts in disparate fields  and user communities and this, in turn, will lead to identification of key areas where opportunities for translational research exists at the intersection of many fields such as biological olfaction, neuromorphic computing,  and materials sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
