 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poisson 2022 is the 12th in a series of biennial international conferences and schools in a subfield of mathematics known as Poisson geometry. The 2022 event includes an Advanced School at the Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona, Spain, July 18-22, 2022 and a Conference at the headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Madrid,  Spain, July 25-29, 2022. Poisson geometry is an area originally inspired by physics, which has found a huge number of applications both in mathematics and other areas of science. This activity will bring together a diverse group of mathematicians to explore the modern interplay between Poisson geometry and its many applications in different fields. The school will consist of four mini-courses given by leading junior and senior mathematicians. It will introduce the participants, mostly early-career mathematicians, to a broad spectrum of ideas on the forefront of modern research in Poisson geometry. The conference program will feature 21 talks given by leading experts, covering the most active topics in Poisson geometry and its applications. The goal of these activities is to make recent developments in the field accessible to all participants, to broaden their perspective on major areas of current research, and to create a stimulating environment in which they can share ideas and begin lasting interdisciplinary collaborations. The purpose of the award is to support the participation of US-based researchers in this event.\r\n\r\nThis meeting aims to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on related areas from different points of view. The Conference is the forum where the most significant recent advances in the area are announced and discussed, and the potential future directions of the subject are addressed. Topics cover a wide range of areas arising from Poisson brackets and its applications, including symplectic, Dirac, generalized complex and related structures, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, Poisson algebras and Poisson varieties, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization and higher structures, non-commutative geometry, quantum groups and representation theory. The School has a strong training component, including two introductory courses in Poisson Geometry and Foliation Theory, and two more advanced level courses in Geometric Quantization and Wonderful Compactifications.  During the opening of the conference, the winner(s) of the Andre Lichnerowicz Prize in Poisson geometry will be announced. The prize is awarded for notable contributions to Poisson geometry and its applications, to researchers who completed their doctorates at most eight years before the year of the Conference. More information about the school is at https://www.crm.cat/2022-advanced-school-poisson/ and conference information is at https://www.icmat.es/congresos/2022/poisson/index.php.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
