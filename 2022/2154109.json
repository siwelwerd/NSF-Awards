 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical beam steering at high speed is of critical importance for many emerging applications, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, free space communications, 3D sensing and imaging systems. Most existing solutions rely on mechanical movements to steer the light beam direction, which is slow and bulky. The objective of this project is to investigate a fast 2D optical beam steering devices based on the electrical tuning of coupled bi-layer photonic crystal cavities directly integrated on high power vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays. High speed phase tuning can be accomplished with the electrical control of refractive index of the semiconductor material. Leveraging the advances in semiconductor laser technology, integrated photonics technology, and nanophotonics, the proposed solution can result in very compact size, low power consumption, and high reliability. Co-design of nanophotonic cavity with high power VCSEL arrays can provide a disruptive technology for high performance laser detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems. Additionally, the project offers a platform for student education and training, help preparation of diversified workforces in photonics and optics, sensing and imaging, nanotechnology, and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nPhase control can be achieved in single and bi-layer coupled photonic crystal slabs. High speed modulation/tuning is feasible with electronic control. Both transmissive and reflective phase tuning elements can be realized with the formation of arrays for high speed spatial light modulators (SLMs) and optical phased arrays (OPAs). The objective here is to investigate some fundamental challenges towards a high scanning speed beam steering OPA structure integrated with high power VCSELs capable of full phase control at 1 GHz speed and above. With this project, various challenges associated with the integrated OPA/VCSEL will be addressed. The integrated modular solution can result in simplified optical design and assembly for compact and reliable LiDAR and beam steering applications. The proposed approach has the following innovative features: (1) High speed: The structure can operate at GHz regime, which will be 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than other approaches based on mechanical scanning technique or conventional spatial light modulator (SLM) technologies. (2) Reliable: The structure is based on co-design and co-packaging of OPAs with VCSELs with simplified optical beam routing schemes and mechanical integration structures.  (3) Scalable: The proposed structure architecture is planar, CMOS compatible, and scalable in 2D, which ensures its manufacturing scalability and device pixel scalability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
