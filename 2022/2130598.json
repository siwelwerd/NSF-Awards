 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research team members will collaborate to use island black rats as bioproxies to understand the history of human voyages across oceanic expanses. Through genetic investigation of species introduced to islands by human voyagers it should be possible to determine when they were introduced.\r\n\r\nThe research team is investigating the origin of long distance maritime movement using genomic analysis of invasive black rats. Recent advances in population genomics, specifically high-throughput genotyping of single base pair DNA changes, whole genome sequencing, and statistical estimation of demographic histories, have made it possible to infer the geographic origins and timing of rat introductions from contemporary samples. Such approaches will be used in this project to learn when, and from where, rats first reached an island setting. Establishing the antiquity of such rat populations will help archaeologists determine sites for future research. This project will significantly revise understanding of remote voyaging networks with all their transformative cultural, economic, and ecological impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
