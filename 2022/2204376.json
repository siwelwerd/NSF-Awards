 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Preston Cosslett Kemeny has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research, professional development, and outreach activities at the University of Chicago under the mentorship of Dr. Clara Bl\u00e4ttler. In this project, Dr. Kemeny will investigate the relationship between trilobite extinction and seawater chemistry during the Cambrian Period (approximately 540 to 485 million years ago). This work has broad implications for establishing robust environmental and ecological policy in the coming decades because understanding the interwoven nature of ancient life and climate provides fundamental context for predicting and responding to anthropogenic climate change. Previously, many interpretations of chemical variability in rocks implicated causal linkages between the global carbon cycle and ecological turnover. However, recent developments in the study of sedimentary processes have suggested that extinction and diversification may only weakly relate to environmental perturbations. The Cambrian Period offers unique opportunities for testing connections between ecology and seawater chemistry because it contains multiple trilobite extinction and diversification intervals associated with chemical anomalies. In this work, Dr. Kemeny will perform geochemical measurements on Cambrian rocks and fossils, and synthesize those observations within a numerical model, to better understand the relationship between extinction and the global carbon cycle. In addition, Dr. Kemeny will continue efforts to create an inclusive community through research, teaching, mentorship, and service activities that increase diversity, equity, inclusivity, and accessibility in the geosciences. These activities will include mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, training in effective and inclusive pedagogy, and working with local teachers to develop publicly available lesson plans on the global carbon cycle and paleontology.\r\n\r\nThis project will study the coevolution of life with climate by quantifying connections between the global carbon cycle and trilobite extinction during the Cambrian Period. Dr. Kemeny will (1) measure calcium and magnesium isotope ratios in drill core samples from the Missouri basin to determine whether the Cambrian Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (SPICE) reflects a shift in the marine 13C/12C ratio or a shift in either the style of post-depositional alteration or mineralogy, (2) test existing hypotheses of marine anoxia during the SPICE event using sulfur and uranium isotope ratios, (3) evaluate trilobite fossils as a novel proxy for diagenetic modification and seawater chemistry, and (4) reproduce the isotopic observations within a box model of the ocean-atmosphere system and numerically constrain the temporal and spatial scales over which diagenesis can produce carbon isotope excursions. By disentangling biodiversity change from environmental change during the SPICE event, this project will take concrete steps towards understanding the coevolution of life with climate. Furthermore, by exploring a trilobite-based proxy for diagenetic alteration, the proposed work may provide a new tool to the geochemical community for reconstructing marine chemistry and for studying connections between the global carbon cycle and ecological turnover throughout the Paleozoic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
