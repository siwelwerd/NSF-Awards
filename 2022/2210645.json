 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea ice plays a critical role in polar ecosystems and in regional and global climate. Sea ice moderates the exchange of carbon dioxide and other gases between the atmosphere and ocean, supports global ocean circulation through salt drainage, acts as an insulator between the warm ocean and cold atmosphere, and plays a key role in polar food webs. Sea ice remains understudied despite its significance due to the difficulty of accessing and analyzing sea ice samples. The sea ice environment is dynamic and presents numerous hazards that require considerable expertise to mitigate; also, because ice is a solid, samples often require more complex preparation for biological and chemical measurements than for seawater. These challenges may be considerable barriers for new investigators, who typically learn how to overcome them through one-on-one training by a mentor, supervisor, and advisor. This award supports travel for US PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to attend an international sea ice field school hosted by the SCAR expert group Biogeochemical Exchange Processes at Sea Ice Interfaces (BEPSII) and SCOR working group Essential Climate Variables in Ice (ECVice). The field school is taking place at the Canadian High Arctic Research Station, a state-of-the-art field station located in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Students at the school receive comprehensive training in field and laboratory best from international and local experts in sea ice physics, biogeochemistry, ecology, and operations, which will help broaden participation within the sea ice community and encourage new investigators to undertake sea ice studies. \r\n \r\nSea ice plays a key role in Arctic and Antarctic biogeochemical cycles.
