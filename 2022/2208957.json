 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The gut is home to trillions of bacteria. These microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiome, work together with their host\u2019s body. Prior research has shown that, depending on host physiology, gut microbiome function can be altered by outside cues, with these changes leading to consequences in the host body. Using zebra finch birds as a model, this project explores how stress (an environmental variable) and hormones from the ovaries and testes (an internal variable) change the microbiome and thus alter host brain inflammation. Despite far-reaching consequences of the gut microbiome to behavior and health, many complexities of understanding how the microbiome affects the brain remain unprobed. This project will provide additional knowledge of how various environmental and internal conditions can alter this symbiosis to affect the brain. The Fellow will also development and assess improved protocols to increase lab accessibility for undergraduates and high school students.  \r\n\r\nThe first aim of this project will determine whether environmental stress alters the microbiome differently in males vs. females to alter neuroinflammation. Male and female finches, with or without microbiome presence will be placed in social isolation or group housing. Microbiome composition and function will be assessed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and carbohydrate utilization analysis, respectively. All animals will then be subjected to penetrating brain injury and their neuroimmune responses assessed via analysis of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways by quantitative PCR and immunoreactivity. The second aim examines the contributions of gonadal hormones to microbiome composition and function and subsequent neuroinflammation in response to penetrating brain injury. Animals will be treated with pharmacological agents to alter androgen or estrogen levels before assessing the microbiome and neuroinflammation profiles as previously stated. In addition to this research, the Fellow will also be working towards developing the skills necessary to teach at and develop a research program suitable for a primarily undergraduate institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
