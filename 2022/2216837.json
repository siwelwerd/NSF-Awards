 "awd_abstract_narration": "The environment around us is constantly changing, in ways both big and small. Biological systems must utilize processes to maintain homeostasis (a physiological equilibrium) in order to continue functioning amidst a fluctuating environment. The electrical activity of neurons controls essential bodily functions and behaviors that are necessary for survival. Within the nervous system, another set of cells, called glia, regulate and support neurons. Recent work by the PI, and others, has shown that glial cells play important roles in helping neurons maintain homeostasis. This project will use genetic tools available in fruit flies to elucidate novel mechanisms for how glia and neurons interact to enable animals to survive and thrive in fluctuating environments. The project will be integrated with inclusive educational practices, including experiments completed by undergraduate students in the PI\u2019s Neurobiology Lab Course, and participation in a research based mentoring program for first year undergraduates from historically underrepresented groups in STEM. This project will also develop a Science Translators Program, creating resources for non-scientists to learn about socially relevant science research, in languages other than English. Together, the objectives of this grant will incorporate a diverse group of students in studying biological mechanisms through which animals respond to stress, giving students opportunities to develop a sense of belonging in STEM, learn hands-on lab skills, and present their work at conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. \r\n\r\nWhile much work has focused on the cell intrinsic and neural circuit level mechanisms through which neurons regulate their excitability, mechanisms by which glia regulate the nervous system response to environmental stress are less well understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster, the PI\u2019s lab has recently identified glial homeostatic roles for two genes, the voltage-gated potassium channel seizure and the ion transporter ncc69, in neuropile ensheathing glia (EGN). EGN have been shown by others to act as phagocytes in adult D. melanogaster, therefore this project tests the hypothesis that glial phagocytosis of neurons, in processes such as synaptic pruning, modulates the ability of the nervous system to maintain homeostasis in response to environmental stress. Furthermore, the project will tease apart the impact of developmental and adult glial function on nervous system homeostasis. Ultimately, the project takes advantage of the wealth of genetic tools, neurophysiological and behavioral assays available in D. melanogaster to uncover basic principles of glial function in their regulation of neural activity and animal behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
