 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving student learning in undergraduate physics using Team-based Learning (TBL) in multiple sections of lower division and advanced level physics classes. The project will address common gaps in students\u2019 conceptual and problem-solving skills using interactive delivery of content that is essential for understanding the fundamental laws of nature. In TBL classes, students engage in learning through pre-class preparation, readiness assurance testing (with immediate feedback), and concept application via group-problem solving. Carefully formed permanent teams of students work on a task that has direct application of physics concepts. By implementing TBL, passive instruction and learning will be replaced with interactive teaching and active engagement learning techniques, which have been shown to be effective in promoting deeper learning and in enhancing social and collaborative skills essential in today\u2019s STEM workforce. By improving students\u2019 understanding and enhancing development of core competencies (such as critical thinking, empirical and quantitative skills, written and oral communication, teamwork skills) the project will benefit the local Hispanic community and serve the national interest of improving quality of education in underrepresented student populations.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: (1) improve the quality of learning of physics students through a concerted effort in implementing Team-Based Learning (TBL); (2) investigate how TBL can be utilized for providing a culturally responsive teaching environment; (3) study the issues associated with the implementation of TBL teaching approach; and (4) create a supportive mechanism for sustaining TBL implementation in multiple physics courses. Physics faculty members will be trained and supported to implement team-based learning in their courses. Working in teams, instructors will redesign their physics courses by developing TBL curriculum materials that engage students while guided by the principles of Backward Design. Lessons learned from this project could provide a model for other departments or institutions for a collaborative approach to implementing active learning in their STEM courses. In addition, the project will provide substantial professional development opportunities for faculty, both locally and nationally, via workshops and hands-on training in the development and implementation of specially designed instructional materials for TBL classes. The project is also expected to generate valuable data on TBL implementation issues, on sustainability of active learning environment in physics classes, and on comparisons of TBL with other active learning techniques. Overall, the project will serve the local community and the national interests of improving STEM education both at the students\u2019 and instructors\u2019 level. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE:HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate\u2019s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
