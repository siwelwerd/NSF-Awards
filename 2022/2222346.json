 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award partially supports the participation of students from US institutions in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), to be held from June 19 to 24, 2022 in New Orleans, Louisiana. CVPR is the premier annual conference in computer vision with over 9,000 senior, junior and student participants. It is held in North America and attended by members of the international research community. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to highlight the work of senior PhD students who are within six months of receiving their degrees (including recent graduates), and to give these students an opportunity to discuss their research and career options with faculty and researchers who have relevant expertise and experience. The opportunity to receive advice on their research work and career plans from experts from different institutions, and with potentially different perspectives, is often not available internally at one's own institution. The project will support the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contribute to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, potentially increasing the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, and ensure that the computer vision community, through its recent graduates, makes fast advances in solving problems that will benefit society. \r\n\r\nThrough a group travel grant, this project ensures the opportunity to participate for students at diverse institutions, including students from underrepresented groups who would otherwise not be able to attend, and enhances the visibility of this outreach program to all attendees. The award covers some of the conference attendance costs for 15-20 selected US-based graduate students. Participants and recipients of travel support are selected by the 2022 CVPR Doctoral Consortium co-chairs. Travel awards partially cover any admissible conference-related costs such as registration, airfare, lodging, and board, up to $1200. The budget also includes support for a light lunch during the Doctoral Consortium event for 60 people (student participants and mentors). This year\u2019s Doctoral Consortium is a hybrid event (allowing in-person and remote participation), features a poster session, one-on-one or small group mentoring, and panel discussion. The Doctoral Consortium aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Doctoral Consortium took place on June 22, 2022, in conjunction with the IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference. Twenty-eight students took part in it, 15 from universities in the United States, and 13 from other universities. The acceptance rate among US-based applicants was 50% (30 applicants total), and among non-US-based ones 45% (29 applicants total). When selecting applicants to participate, the DC co-chairs considered merit based on publications, as well as diverse participation from multiple genders, races, and institutions. Many applications from universities that are not commonly represented at  CVPR were received; providing a travel stipend for these students, and  pairing them with well-known senior researchers, is likely to be very  helpful to advance their careers in the field. Each participating student was paired with a mentor from academy or industry (based on a list of preferences they expressed for mentors) for one-on-one advising. Mentors were invited, and a panel with five speakers was organized. The PI's institution reimbursed the travel costs of US-based participants using the stipends provided by this grant. Many participating students expressed gratitude for the event. The questions asked during the panel were very pertinent to many participants.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/13/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adriana&nbsp;Kovashka</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
