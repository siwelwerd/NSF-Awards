 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project seeks to enhance the curriculum and student training at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) by incorporating state-of-the-art 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that are critical to people\u2019s lives and the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThe project strives to intrigue students\u2019 learning passion by systematically designing/redesigning Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curricula at PVAMU through incorporating state-of-the-art technologies and much needed practical skills. Furthermore, the project will collaborate with industrial partners to bridge the gap between the academy and industry to ensure that the skills and knowledge of PVAMU STEM students is up-to-date and relevant in current 5G and IoT technologies. In addition, the results of the activities will be disseminated to the broader communities through publications and conference presentations, and project outcomes, such as the created courses, modules, and learning materials will be held at a dedicated website and be made available for other educators to use. This project will have significant impact on the education and research in the ECE department, and greatly improve students\u2019 knowledge in emerging technologies, better preparing them for graduate study and the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
