 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project at the University of Mississippi aims to establish an interdisciplinary research and educational program in nanoengineering that provides seminal, transformative experiences in research to ten undergraduate students. This program will promote the advancement of nanoengineering research in the state of Mississippi and the Southeastern United States by catalyzing research collaborations as part of the REU activities. The project will contribute to the development of a future STEM workforce by providing research training opportunities to undergraduates from non-research intensive institutions. The REU activities will contribute solutions to major societal challenges of the 21st century, particularly in the areas of health, energy, and manufacturing. This project will contribute significantly to the development of nanotechnology-based solutions to today\u2019s major societal challenges. \r\n\r\nThe three-year Nanoengineering Summer REU Program at the University of Mississippi will immerse ten students per year in the growing field of nanoengineering through research in one of three cognate areas: nanobiotechnology, sustainable nanoengineering, and computational nanoengineering. Nanobiotechnology leverages innovative technologies such as nanoparticles, nanodevices, and surface coatings that can be used to study biological systems and produce novel biosensors, diagnostics, imaging agents, and therapeutics. Computational nanoengineering involves the use of computational tools to solve theoretical problems at the nanoscale and/or augment experimental techniques in nanoengineering. Sustainable nanoengineering seeks to harness the unique energetic properties of nanomaterials to produce environmentally-friendly solutions to problems in industrial processing, energy development, and pollution, among other applications. The Nanoengineering REU will also serve as an outreach opportunity to engage students who might not otherwise have research opportunities. Overall, the REU will increase student interest in pursuing careers in STEM research by: (1) exposing students to innovative interdisciplinary research, (2) integrating educational seminars, (3) promoting mentorship from graduate student and faculty role models, (4) providing training for national scholarship and graduate school applications, and (5) organizing social activities to promote a congenial and inclusive atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
