DISC is a premier conference on distributed computing with an emphasis on theoretical foundations, modeling, and analysis of distributed systems. This grant will help to broaden the student participation in the conference and expose the students to state-of-the-art research on distributed computing. Emphasis is given to students from underrepresented population groups. The grant aims to support 20 students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
