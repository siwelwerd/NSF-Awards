 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum metrology is the study of making high-resolution and highly sensitive measurements of physical parameters using quantum theory. Development in this field will not only improve our understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of nature, but also advance national security and technology. Nonclassical states of light are essential resources for achieving enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology. Quantitative understanding of these states as a resource for quantum-enhanced tasks is crucial for practical sensing applications. However, such a perspective on nonclassical states for quantum metrology is not fully developed. This project will take the new perspective to investigate methods of quantifying nonclassical states in the framework of a resource theory for quantum-enhanced metrology. The results of this project could provide new schemes for performing quantum metrology using nonclassical states and motivate new experiments, which will build the foundations for future quantum technologies. Broader impacts of this project include training graduate students in theoretical quantum physics, providing research opportunities for advanced undergraduates, and building a diverse workforce in quantum information science.\r\n\r\nThis project is at the intersection of three research frontiers: quantum metrology, nonclassical states, and quantum resource theories. Quantum resource theories provide a powerful framework for studying quantum phenomena from a new foundational perspective. Based on the resource theory of nonclassicality, the PI\u2019s group will investigate quantum channels of modeling optical loss of a nonclassical state and the metrological power of a nonclassical state in an optical lossy environment for exploring robust states for quantum metrology. The PI\u2019s group will also study resource-theory tasks in manipulating these nonclassical states for metrology. These tasks will help to understand quantitatively what operations can enhance the resource of a state and what operations can reduce the nonclassicality. The PI\u2019s group will investigate the distribution of nonclassicality of a state in a linear network using the resource theory. The outcomes of the designated research can provide new schemes of experiments in quantum metrology and develop a deeper understanding of nonclassicality as a resource for quantum information science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
