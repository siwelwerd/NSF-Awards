 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a portable, affordable, multiline braille display powered by chemical fuels. In this increasingly digital society, computer screens serve as the primary interface for consuming and communicating information. Blind and visually impaired people cannot use computers by conventional means, instead using audio-based, screen reading software and refreshable braille displays to meet digital information needs. Braille displays, which are needed for precision reading and writing tasks (such as checking spelling and grammar) can only present a single line of information, usually 40 characters at a time. The display limitations of these devices are exacerbated by their staggering costs; Reliable displays are priced at $3,000 or more. Current actuation technologies cannot meet the need for multiline devices due to their high material and integration costs, and core technologies have remained essentially unchanged for decades.  Lowering the cost of a single-line display may increase accessibility for the blind, while an affordable multiline display may result in even greater impact. The goal for the proposed technology is to meet needs to both extend access to businesses and institutions that seek to provide refreshable braille to their own employees, customers, and visitors.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a multiline braille display powered by chemical fuels.  The proposed technology is based on a soft microfluidic system that distributes gaseous chemical fuels to microliter volume cylinders. Sparks ignite the gas in individual chambers resulting in the pulsed actuation of elastomeric membranes that cover the top of each cylinder. The core innovation enabling this functionality stems from the realization that the flames in each cylinder quench themselves at the microfluidic intake port. Thus, valves are not required to control individual actuations, previously unrealized in soft, pneumatic actuation arrays. Removing the need for valves simplifies the system architecture, reduces system size, and substantially lowers the system cost. The system level innovations in this project mayu resolve downstream technical challenges present in other tactile display technologies. An all-rubber composition allows for the design of a hermetically sealed platform which prevents dust and liquid ingress, and which may eliminate damage from impact. In addition, while maintenance is a large pain point for many braille display customers, the proposed display interface is inexpensive and may be completely replaced, as it contains small volumes of molded silicone rubber and wire.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
