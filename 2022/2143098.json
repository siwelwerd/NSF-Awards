 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the global growth in greenhouse gas emissions today comes from low- and middle-income countries. Reducing global carbon emissions will therefore require developing countries to use more renewable energy instead of fossil energy. There is no prior model for such growth. Many of the institutions being used to promote a green energy transition in developed countries\u2014like broad energy markets driven by private investment, or market-based environmental regulation\u2014either do not exist or are relatively new in developing countries. This CAREER project will study how institutions for green growth are working in developing countries and how they could be made stronger. The study will  identify policy tools that can lower the cost of energy for the poor and promote green economic growth that causes less pollution. The results of this CAREER research will improve efficiency in energy markets, improve policies for carbon abatement globally, contributions to graduate and undergraduate student training, and data collection and dissemination.  The results of this research project will also establish the US as a global leader in \u201cclean\u201d energy research and policy.\r\n\r\nThis research project will study the efficacy of several institutions for carbon abatement in developing countries. The program has three parts: (i) institutions to support private investment in renewable energy, (ii) market-based environmental regulation and (iii) international carbon offsets. The first part will study how institutions to help enforce contracts have helped to bring down renewable energy prices in low income countries using data on the entire history of solar power industry. The empirical analysis will measure the effect of contractual risk, which is widespread in developing countries, on the price of green energy adoption. The second part will use data from a large, novel experiment introducing emissions trading for local air pollution to estimate a model of the gains from market-based regulation. The third part will study how the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the largest such transfer program in the world to date, has affected greenhouse gas emissions in low income countries, especially the largest and fastest growing emitters.  The main mechanisms for these transfers, including offset mechanisms, have not been well studied for their efficacy or costs. Looking across these several institutions, the project as a whole will study second-best environmental and energy policy in practice and recommend policy changes that can work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
