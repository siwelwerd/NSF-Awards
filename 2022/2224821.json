 "awd_abstract_narration": "These NSF funds provide support to students and early career clay scientists. U.S. based participants will have the opportunity to attend an international conference dedicated to the study of clays in Istanbul, Turkey. The meeting is being jointly run with the U.S. based Clay Minerals Society and the International Association for the Study of Clays (AIPEA). The conference will cover clay-focused topics. Clays exist in soils, household products, medicines, building materials, new nanomaterials, and with strategic resources (including oil shales and rare earth element deposits). It is important to bring together senior U.S. based clay scientists with like-minded senior international scientists. This way ideas are shared, debated, and advanced through collaboration and ultimately publication. This International clay conference first met nearly 70 years ago. Like the Olympics, it occurs every four years to showcase the world\u2019s best clay innovations. It is the largest and most respected gathering of clay scientists. At this meeting, U.S. based students and early career scientists become educated and network with senior scientists on a variety of topics. The goal of networking is to train future scientists and develop international relationships. These relationships make it more accessible to explore the timeless advancements of clay science.\r\n\r\nThis conference hosts four workshops on the topics: 1) AIPEA School for Young Scientists on Kaolin origins, properties, and applications, 2) Advances in the characterization of smectites and bentonites, 3) Clay minerals catalysis of organic reactions, and 4) Early Career Clay Scientists workshop.  The first and fourth workshops are targeted toward connecting experienced scientists with younger scientists on key topics and explore ways to better publish, obtain funding, and network. All the workshops are led by experts from government, academia, and industry, who have widely published and are highly respected in the clay research community. Two field trips will be led to important economic clay deposits where the exploration, mining, and end-product uses of clays are examined. Over 27 thematic sessions at the conference cover a wide range of topics, which are of interest to geobiology and low temperature geochemistry. Technical disciplines include those relating to mineralogy, critical zone science, environmental science, medicine and health science, functionalized clays and materials science, soil science, engineering and geotechnical applications, planetary sciences, teaching clay science, history of clay societies, and industrial materials. Low-cost housing is available to all student participants. This is located on the campus of Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey.  This venue also boasts historically important locations in the legacy of science where \u201cEast meets West\u201d. This is indicated by the conference theme \u201cNew Interfaces: Bridging Continents and Cultures with Clays\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Fifteen students and early career scientist from U.S. based institutions were supported to attend this and a subsequent meeting of the CMS. They were able to attend 294 presentations covered in 34 different thematic sessions. Numerous opportunities to network were afforded through events that included meetings with journal editors, best paper/poster competitions, cultural tours of historic sites, social receptions, a workshop on clay uses, a field trip to regional clay mines, and a Gala dinner. Additionally, this meeting marked the establishment of the first new working group of self-directing early career and student clay scientists. The goal of this international group has many facets, which includes,&nbsp;how to write a good research proposal; how to fund the research projects, how early career researchers can apply for grants and submit the research proposals in response to different institutional, national, and international calls. The idea is to provide early career researchers with a \"beginner's toolkit\" for how to design a successful research proposal. This is all led by invited clay scientists with successful careers. This meeting marked one of the first post-pandemic face-to-face conferences. Considering the challenges of international travel related to uncertainties about the war in Ukraine and varied policies of government COVID-19 testing and travel restrictions, there was a remarkably good turn out that included both virtual and physical participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final program and publication of abstracts presented at the meeting are freely available at the CMS website&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clays.org/international-clay-conference/\">https://www.clays.org/international-clay-conference/</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schroeder</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682946943558_CMSStudentawardees--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682946943558_CMSStudentawardees--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CMS travel awardees\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682946943558_CMSStudentawardees--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CMS travel awardees\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Awardees of the travel support program received recognition at a dinner for all conference attendees</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CMS travel awardees</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947047593_CMSCulturaltrip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947047593_CMSCulturaltrip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cultural Field trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947047593_CMSCulturaltrip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cultural Field trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student and early career clay scientists experience the historic sites of Istanbul</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cultural Field trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947176983_CMSFieldtrip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947176983_CMSFieldtrip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Clay mine visit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947176983_CMSFieldtrip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Clay mine visit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students and early clay scientists visit a major mining operation in the Sile region, which supplies clay for ceramics industry.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Clay mine visit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947339440_CMSGalaevent--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947339440_CMSGalaevent--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gala event\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2224821/2224821_10795301_1682947339440_CMSGalaevent--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gala event\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students and early career scientists see the Bosphorus and meet other clay scientist during a cruise of historic sites.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schroeder</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gala event</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
