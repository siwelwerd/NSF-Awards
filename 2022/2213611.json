 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the organization of a National Science Foundation Directorate for Engineering 2022 Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held virtually in the Spring of 2022, and it is expected that there will be about 600 attendees. The workshop will take place over three days and will include interactive sessions on good proposal writing practices, reflections by previous CAREER awardees, and a mock CAREER proposal panel review. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with current NSF Program Directors both in one-on-one and in mock panel sessions. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help to prepare CAREER program eligible faculty for careers in education and research by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing for submissions to the CAREER program as well as core NSF programs. The objectives of the workshop include training for junior faculty with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities in engineering. A special additional emphasis will be placed on encouraging CAREER program eligible faculty from non-\"Research-1\" institutions to apply for participation. The workshop will serve as an introduction to NSF for many new researchers. The workshop will help participants to clarify their research and education career plans and to understand the need to clearly articulate these plans to external reviewers. In addition, the workshop includes mock panel sessions to give participants the experience of simulated panel evaluation discussions. All of the content and experiences will help attendees enrich their skills for writing successful research proposals on impactful research that benefits societal needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Workshop was  open to multidisciplinary researchers across the United States with an ENG focus. The major  sessions of the Workshop were to include presentations on proposal  writing, mock panels, and networking.\n\n\nOver 800 applications were  received for the virtual workshop. 778 junior faculty were registered  to attend the general sessions held May 11th and May 13th. Only 39% of the registrants (305 junior faculty) were selected for the mock panel session on May 12, 2022.\n\n\nThe  Mock Panel participants were divided into 30 panels (approximately 10  participants per panel) to review and rate four previously funded and  non-funded NSF ENG CAREER proposals. The Workshop participants were  able to critique past successful and unsuccessful NSF CAREER proposals.  At the panel each of the proposals were placed in a funding category  and ranked. The results of each panel were compared and discussed.\n\n\nAt  the end of the conference, participants were asked to complete an  online evaluation survey. A total of 192 participants completed the  workshop evaluation and 199 participants completed the mock panel  session.\n\n\nThe workshop was  rated positively: 74.87% strongly agreed that the workshop was valuable,  and 80.32% strongly agreed that they would recommend it to a friend.
