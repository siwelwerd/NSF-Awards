 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to enable improved safety for next generation lithium-ion batteries, used in many applications, such as electronics, electric vehicles, and other specialty applications.  With a projected growth over 10% annually over the next decade, the lithium-ion cathode material market is expected to exceed $30 B by 2030, creating a significant commercial potential. This project will develop a coating to improve the durability, capacity, and low-temperature performance of lithium-ion batteries; it will be deployed industrially in a modular and flexible fashion. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase II project proposes to develop and validate an industrial manufacturing prototype of a graphene-based coating technology for rapid commercialization of emerging high-performance cathode materials. The resulting innovation will demonstrate the commercial viability of the graphene functionalization to address key technical issues facing the next-generation Ni-rich high energy density cathodes such as chemical instability, narrow operating conditions, and high cell impedance growth. This technology provides a comprehensive solution to precisely target these pain points through integration of nanotechnology with traditional lithium-ion battery systems. The overarching goals of the proposed research activities include (1) development of fully continuous-flow graphene-based coating precursor production; (2) implementation of pilot-scale roll-to-roll graphene-based coating process for Ni-rich cathode microparticles; (3) development and validation of alternate coating pathways for early validation, and (4) pouch cell prototyping efforts for commercial validation of increases in cycle life, chemical stability, and rate and temperature performance. This project will advance the technology for seamless integration into existing battery manufacturing lines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
