 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this conference aims to identify the unique challenges that administrators, staff, faculty and students in the US Southwest urban and rural HSI community colleges face when introducing high-impact educational practices such as Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in STEM curricula. While the impact of CUREs on student success parameters has been widely demonstrated in research intensive 4-year institutions, little is known of the benefits of CUREs in community colleges and other 2-year educational institutions, specifically those with significant percentages of underserved students, such as HSI community colleges. This conference will provide a platform to discuss lessons learned, to evaluate strategies for improvement, and to identify and provide effective tools to 2-year HSI institutions that are considering the introduction of CUREs in their programs while documenting the needs, barriers, successes, and benefits associated with CURE implementation in STEM HSI community college courses. Conference outcomes will include: equity-minded models for CURE design, implementation, and assessment in line with the needs of HSIs; partnership and collaborative strategies among 4-year colleges and urban and rural 2-year colleges for industry engagement in CURE design and execution; improved understanding of high impact practices in STEM teaching and learning; improved understanding of what constitutes cultural relevance in HSIs; and best practices for improving the success rate of HSIs in obtaining external funding to support high impact educational interventions.\r\n\r\nThe conference aims to lay a foundation for understanding methodology, benefits and challenges of CURE implementation in HSI CCs, and for establishing strategies of efficient collaboration between 4-year universities, rural and urban community colleges, industry, and community organizations in order to improve the quality of education of underserved student populations. The conference will build on NSF-funded University of Arizona HSI Conference: Transforming STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions - Regional Insights from the Southwest (NSF DUE 1748526) and Central Arizona College HSI Conference: Transforming STEM Education at Rural Hispanic-Serving Institutions Across the Nation (NSF DUE 1940949) and will increase knowledge and understanding of the specific challenges and opportunities that introducing high impact educational strategies such as CUREs represent for STEM undergraduate education at 2-year HSIs and how to better serve the needs of students. The conference will generate a report with conference outcomes, recommendations, and resources. Conference results will be disseminated to governmental agencies and higher education organizations via appropriate educational research journals, presentations at regional and national conferences, and institutional social media outlets. Conference findings will inform funding priorities for high impact educational interventions in HSIs, and provide effective models for student engagement and collaboration with industry and other community organizations, ultimately impacting career preparedness of students attending HSIs. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A Consensus Report serves as a resource and a summary of the recommendations that emerged from analyses of needs, challenges, barriers, opportunities, and strategies to improve CURE design, implementation, sustainability, and institutionalization in STEM HSI 2-year and community college courses.  Nine themes emerged from analyses of participants? input. Themes indicated that normalization of CUREs in HSIs requires educating professionals at various levels (administration, faculty, and students) about the benefits of CUREs by providing evidence of CURE impact on student success. Barriers to CURE development, implementation, and institutionalization affected the three academic bodies and were identified as focus areas, as they negatively impact the normalization of CUREs as a high impact instructional practice.  For students, CUREs have to encompass meaningful research that reflects their values and societal concerns, align with their notion of success, and provide a positive academic experience.  For faculty, CUREs have to be made into as light a lift as possible. That involves support, training, resources, undergoing a personal cultural shift focused on prioritizing high impact practices in their courses, and making their CUREs inclusive and culturally relevant/responsive.  The support necessary includes funding for professional development, materials, reassigned time for developing and evaluating their CUREs and establishing partnerships at different levels, and a general recognition that this process would require a shift in thinking about science education.  Institutions have to engage in ways to support CURE implementation and normalization by providing resources to faculty and by prioritizing high impact practices in their strategic and academic plans. Establishing partnerships with industry and community organizations is a very effective way to facilitate the development of CUREs that are culturally inclusive and relevant/responsive, as well as to gain access to resources and opportunities for faculty professional growth and student career development.\nThe Consensus Report can be found through this link:\nhttps://www.phoenixcollege.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/CUREs-HSI-2022-Consensus-Report.pdf\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anna Marti-Subirana"
