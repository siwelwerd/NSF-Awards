This conference will feature some of the most renowned researchers in the interplay between geometry and partial differential equations who will present the state of the art of the various topics covered. The potential benefits for young researchers and researchers in nearby fields will be central; it is expected that these researchers will discover important techniques and perspectives. The project will support the transportation and accommodation of speakers and participants to the conference, with emphasis on graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from American universities.\r\n\r\nWithin the general field of geometric analysis, the conference will focus on microlocal analysis, gauge theory, conformal invariants, analysis on non-compact manifolds including the study of index theory and de Rham cohomologies as well as wave propagation, and the study of geometric flows. These topics are chosen because of many recent advances and numerous open frontiers, and because in spite of many connections between them, there is sufficient distance between these topics that collaborative projects, benefiting from different points of view, are particularly fruitful. A key goal of the conference is to show young researchers, such as graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, the variety of areas in which microlocal analysis is a useful tool, with the expectation that they might be able to start collaborative projects in these areas. The organizers will also strive to ensure the diversity of the participants to the maximum extent possible. The web page of the conference is https://web.stanford.edu/~andras/microloc-conf-22.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
