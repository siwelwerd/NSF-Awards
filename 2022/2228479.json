 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project plans to establish an urban hydrology monitoring network within the City of Cape Canaveral, Florida, through a participatory charrette process. Like many coastal communities, Cape Canaveral is confronted with the stressors of growing flood risk and harmful algal blooms in nearshore waters. A combination of antiquated infrastructure in the built environment and accelerating climate change is amplifying the impacts of both urban flooding and algal blooms, resulting in increasing threats to public safety, ecosystem health, and private property. The Cape Canaveral municipal government, in collaboration with its academic and community partners, is planning to design, implement, monitor, and assess nature-based green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) as an approach for mitigating these current and future stressors. This GSI monitoring network will provide important benefits for Cape Canaveral and the broader Indian River Lagoon watershed of eastern Florida, while also demonstrating opportunities for optimizing and assessing GSI performance in similarly vulnerable coastal locations.  \r\n\r\nGSI refers to a set of stormwater management practices that are designed to maintain, restore, and/or mimic pre-development hydrologic conditions within built environments. These practices are being increasingly promoted as a tool for reducing flood risk, improving water quality, enhancing urban habitat, and creating valuable green space amenities. However, GSI has not yet been adopted at scale in much of the U.S., including areas \u2013 like much of coastal Florida \u2013 where existing stormwater infrastructure systems are largely maladapted to climate change-driven flood risks and often identified as a primary pollutant load source into impaired aquatic ecosystems. A relative lack of monitoring and performance data, ambiguous permitting design standards, and misunderstood maintenance protocols are all commonly cited as key barriers to the wider application of GSI, in Florida and elsewhere. To help overcome these barriers, Cape Canaveral is motivated to serve as a partner and host for an applied research program that comprehensively tests the field performance of GSI interventions for mitigating locally severe stormwater-based flooding and non-point nutrient load issues. Key research goals for the fully implemented project include characterization of stormwater infiltration rate-capacity, areal nutrient-load reduction performance, and public valuation of GSI systems as a municipal amenity. Results are anticipated to facilitate greater GSI research and adoption in the imperiled Indian River Lagoon watershed, home to 1.5 million people and often described as the most biodiverse estuary in North America, and broadly impact the evolution of GSI monitoring practices in urbanized coastal communities across the world. This project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2014Track A. Living in a changing climate: pre-disaster action around adaptation, resilience, and mitigation\u2014and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Cape Canaveral is a coastal barrier island community in central Florida that in recent years has experienced substantially increased flooding due to a combination of sea-level rise, extreme rainfall, and antiquated stormwater drainage infrastructure. While the municipal government in Cape Canaveral has embraced a variety of nature-based GSI interventions in its efforts to address local flooding and water quality challenges, there is widespread recognition that careful research into the performance efficacy of GSI is needed to advance the practice more widely. During our Stage 1 project, three community \"charette\" workshops were held in Cape Canaveral, with the goal of gathering input from local citizens, elected officials, municipal staff, and technical experts about local flooding issues and the suitability of different GSI interventions for addressing these issues. This charette process led to the selection of a site at Cape Canaveral's Veteran's Memorial Park for implementation of a native plant-based&nbsp;bioswale during the&nbsp;research-based Stage 2 pilot project phase. The bioswale site is being co-designed to capture additional stormwater volume, increase the treatment of nutrients, create urban pollinator habitat, and provide a new point of aesthetic reflection for local veteran's groups that frequently use the park for solemn memorial events recognizing the ultimate sacrifices made by military and space program personnel. Cape Canaveral has agreed to collaborate closely with the research team on research-based monitoring and performance assessments of stormwater infiltration rates, nutrient-load reduction, native plant survivability, and maintenance costs over the course of the 12-month Stage 2 pilot project. Results from the Stage 2 pilot project will be used locally to inform implementation of a 25-year, municipal-scale GSI plan recently adopted by the City of Cape Canaveral and will be leveraged to provide science-based guidance for development of GSI standards at regional watershed and statewide scales. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jason&nbsp;M&nbsp;Evans</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685466843237_VeteransRainGarden1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685466843237_VeteransRainGarden1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bioswale Rendering #1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685466843237_VeteransRainGarden1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bioswale Rendering #1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Concept drawing of proposed bioswale intervention at the City of Cape Canaveral's Veteran's Memorial Park</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kimley Horn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jason&nbsp;M&nbsp;Evans</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bioswale Rendering #1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685466976200_VeteransRainGarden2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685466976200_VeteransRainGarden2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bioswale Rendering #2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685466976200_VeteransRainGarden2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bioswale Rendering #2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Concept drawing of proposed bioswale intervention at the City of Cape Canaveral's Veteran's Memorial Park</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kimely Horn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jason&nbsp;M&nbsp;Evans</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bioswale Rendering #2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685467065572_VeteransRainGarden3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685467065572_VeteransRainGarden3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bioswale Rendering #3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685467065572_VeteransRainGarden3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bioswale Rendering #3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Concept drawing of proposed bioswale intervention at the City of Cape Canaveral's Veteran's Memorial Park</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kimley Horn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jason&nbsp;M&nbsp;Evans</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bioswale Rendering #3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685467104696_VeteransRainGarden4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685467104696_VeteransRainGarden4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bioswale Rendering #4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228479/2228479_10824581_1685467104696_VeteransRainGarden4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bioswale Rendering #4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Concept drawing of proposed bioswale intervention at the City of Cape Canaveral's Veteran's Memorial Park</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kimley Horn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jason&nbsp;M&nbsp;Evans</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bioswale Rendering #4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
