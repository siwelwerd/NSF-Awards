 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Some of the largest creatures on the planet (whales and sharks) are filter feeders. Interestingly, filter feeders with enormous body sizes have evolved numerous times. This research seeks to explore the functional performance of oral filters in baleen whales and basking sharks. Both lineages filter using bristle-like filters composed of mineralized keratin to capture small prey items from the water. Baleen whales and basking sharks provide invaluable test cases for understanding the relationships between body size and foraging strategy. This work will provide new insights into the physiology of ecologically important and endangered animals.\r\n\r\nThe work represents an integrative approach using engineering, physics, and biology to identify the filtration mechanisms used by giant bristle-filter feeders. The project will investigate the filter performance by performing a hierarchical investigation, beginning with detailed anatomical descriptions. Based on the filter anatomy, the fellow will perform investigations to identify the flow around the filter and the mechanisms and performance of the filter. This will provide critical information for bio-inspired designed efforts which have the potential to lead to major advances in industrial filtration systems. Furthermore, these tests will clarify why the biggest vertebrates to have ever lived are filter feeders and will provide insight into their role as ecosystem engineers. Taken together, these proposed studies will deliver key insights into the convergent evolution of massive filter feeders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
