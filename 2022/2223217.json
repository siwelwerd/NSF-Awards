 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nLithium-ion batteries power much of our daily lives from portable electronics, power tools, to medical devices, but their adoption in more strategically important applications such as transportation electrification and grid storage is slower due to concerns raised over their safety, reliability, and energy density. Integrating nonflammable inorganic solid electrolytes with high-capacity Li metal anodes to make solid-state lithium metal batteries are considered a promising approach to significantly improve the safety and energy density of existing batteries. However, metallic lithium dendrites tend to form in a variety of solid electrolytes during charging, causing short-circuit risk, by mechanisms that remain elusive. In this project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Fudong Han and his research group at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will study the underlying causes of dendrite formation in solid electrolytes by probing the nucleation and growth of dendrites during battery operation. The project not only provides critical scientific knowledge to develop advanced solid electrolytes for maintaining and advancing US battery technology leadership, but also supports STEM education and workforce development in the energy storage field. The research involves the utilization of advanced neutron scattering techniques at national facilities, and developments in cell design, real-time measurement, and data analysis for the technique also enhance national infrastructure development.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nWith support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the Division of Materials Research, this hypothesis-driven research seeks to probe nucleation and growth dynamics of Li dendrites in inorganic solid electrolytes. Combining state-of-the-art ceramic synthesis, operando neutron scattering measurement, and advanced data modeling and analysis, this project aims to reveal the nucleation and growth pathways, competitions between growth and dissolution, and temperature-dependent shape evolutions of dendrites formed in solid electrolytes. The research provides unprecedented insights in understanding how the dendrites observed from the conventional macroscopic techniques are formed at the very early stage for development of dendrite-resistant solid electrolytes. The development of in-situ small-angle neutron scattering to probe the formation of alien species in a dense ceramic enables further electrochemical materials research where microstructure variations occur at the macroscopic scale. In addition to advancing the fundamental materials chemistry, the multi-disciplinary research also provides ample educational and outreach opportunities for students at different levels, including those from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
