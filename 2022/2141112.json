 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is the production of a nanofluid with aggregated colloidal nanoparticles that can significantly reduce the use of harmful solvents in oil and gas production.  Substantial quantities of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) solvents are currently being used to remediate asphaltene deposits in plugged pipelines and wellbores for flow assurance.  This remediation method is costly and environmentally polluting; thus, many oil and gas operators are making a concerted effort to reduce BTEX solvents from their operations. This research project develops a novel micellar formulation that utilizes multifunctional chemistries to deliver solvents directly to the organic deposits.  The proposed direct replacement nanofluid seeks to reduce harmful solvent use in asphaltene remediation by over 40%, thus, significantly reducing their environmental impact. Entrepreneurship and leadership training for students involved in the project is also proposed.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will determine the scalability and applicability of the micellar nanofluids for asphaltene remediation.  The technical challenge is the variability of the conditions, including oil type, temperatures, pressures, and surface chemistries.  This project aims to evaluate the performance of the nanofluid under conditions expected in oil and gas fields.  A three-pronged approach is proposed.  The first uses a microfluidic method to screen a variety of asphaltene deposition and remediation conditions to identify which will be the most effective. The second uses a core-flood setup to scale up testing to field conditions and the third is a flow loop setup to mimic pipeline conditions that can be piloted in the field.  The team has explored the vast parameter space to identify which conditions should be used to optimize the nanofluid. The result of this project is both a technical and economic assessment of implementing this nanofluid technology in the oil and gas industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
