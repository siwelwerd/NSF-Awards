 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve buildings envelopes that exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and cause quality of life problems. The technology seeks to provide a non-invasive, integrated solution to locate and document moisture intrusion, thermal bridges, and air leaks to diagnose building envelope issues. The system identifies and quantifies common envelope defects and applies long-wave radar and deep learning to detect hidden deep moisture penetration and other major envelope defects. With this system, it is possible to perform low-cost, targeted micro-retrofits to address envelope issues. This project has the potential to (1) increase the efficiency and detection abilities of building health monitoring techniques; (2) increase the resilience of built infrastructure through comprehensive asset management and preventative building maintenance owing to improved early detection capabilities; (3) enable a strong cross collaboration across local government, industry, non-profits, and academia.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a non-invasive, integrated solution to locate and document moisture intrusion, thermal bridges, and air leaks in buildings. The system identifies and quantifies common envelope defects and applies long-wave radar and deep learning to detect hidden deep moisture penetration and other major envelope defects. Once identified, it may be possible to perform low-cost, targeted micro-retrofits to address the envelope issues. This project is a amalgamation of a number of complementary technologies that have the potential to significantly improve the field of building health monitoring.  Project outcomes may enhance the ability to solve current building envelope inspections problems, increase the resilience of widely-used aging commercial and residential infrastructures, and provide a foundation for further study of non-destructive testing on building envelopes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
