 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Middle Tennessee State University is acquiring an ultra high performance liquid chromatograph with a tandem high resolution mass spectrometer (UHPLC MS) to support the research of Professor Mengliang Zhang and colleagues Andrienne Friedli, Ngee-Sing Chong, Tony Johnston, and Ying Gao. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of forensics, medicinal, organic, agricultural and materials chemistry. UHPLC MS is an analytical instrument that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components are heated and flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized. The ions' masses are measured very accurately. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The various ionization sources provide added flexibility with regard to the types of samples that are analyzed. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. The instrument will be used to trains a student population with large proportions of women and people from ethnic groups that are underrepresented in the chemical sciences. The proportion of students from low-income backgrounds and those who are first-generation college students across the university lend credence to the ability of the project to influence the participation of such students in STEM. The instrument gives students experience using vital instrumentation that they carry with them into their careers.\r\n\r\nThe award of this mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts areas including forensics, medicinal, organic, agricultural and materials chemistry. Research is focused on the screening of chemical profiles and determining characteristics for chemical identification, the identification of biomarkers, drug discovery, development of synthetic products as anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer agents, detailed understanding of fermentation and phytochemical transformation, and the sequencing of peptoids.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
