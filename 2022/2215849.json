 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing an online platform that will help to improve retention in introductory computing courses. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the demand for computing jobs will continue to grow in the coming years. However, the projected number of computer science graduates does not meet the predicted demand. One of the reasons for this is the high dropout rates of computing majors. A computer science degree is tied to developing technical skills, which may be taught while students solve problems involving challenging tasks. Solving such challenging tasks helps students to learn but often results in struggles with the material. While such struggles are usually linked with diminishing self-efficacy, these struggles can become instruments to promote learning and self-efficacy, thus becoming productive struggles. Converting classroom challenges to productive struggles as a means for learning may help to improve retention in introductory computer science classes. The online platform, called PULSE (Productive strUggle for deveLoping Self Efficacy), is intended to foster productive struggles, improve self-efficacy, and enhance skill development. \r\n\r\nPULSE will make use of long-form computer programming assignments outside the classroom. The platform will use machine learning-driven approaches to identify the obstacles students face while solving a programming assignment. This will enable instructors to intervene when students struggle, allowing students to learn from the struggles and improve their work before the submission deadline. The project should advance computer science education by generating new knowledge about student struggles and programming activity patterns in solving coding problems outside the classroom. The insights of the proposed research may provide ways to reduce student dropout rates in introductory computing classes in college. PULSE will be released as open-source software allowing other institutions to deploy it in their programming courses. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE:HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate\u2019s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
