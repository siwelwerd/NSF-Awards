 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award enables about 20 US students to attend the 2022 Association of Computing Machinery International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM, pronounced \"wisdom\"), which will be held in Phoenix, Arizona (https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2022/) from February 21 to February 25, 2022. The aim is to support a diverse group of students and make it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. The conference also provides an opportunity for them to interact with national and international researchers. \r\n\r\nThe WSDM conference, which was established in 2008, brings together researchers and industry practitioners into a comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers, tutorials, doctoral symposium, and a machine learning competition-style event (WSDM cup). The program includes publications relating to web search and data mining defined broadly, and particularly encourages publications on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance. The program also includes workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current research and development in web search and data mining, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research projects with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. In recent years, about 500 attendees attended WSDM, and we expect the same this year as well.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Due to the pandemic, the conference was moved to a fully virtual structure through official arrangements via ACM with a company, Whova. ACM WSDM 2023 was held in Singapore, 2/27-3/3, 2023. Due to the unclear situation of the pandemic, the conference supported both in-person and virtual participation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />The conference included a dynamic and comprehensive program, including research papers, tutorials, technical demonstrations, and student research competition. The program also includes workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current web search and mining research and development, a Doctoral symposium, WSDM cup, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />WSDM 2022 had 517 virtual registrants, out of which 156 were from the US.

The remaining balance was used to support students to participant WSDM 2023, which 7 students attended in person. The search committee decided to award all the applicants to cover their major expense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In total, this award was used to sponsor 47 US-based students to attend WSDM 2022 and WSDM 2023. It supported 36 students to register for WSDM 2022. It supported 11 students to participate in WSDM 2023, where 7 students attended the conference in person. All the student awardees are matriculated in US institutions. They have actively participated in the conference through presentations, technical demonstrations, and other direct contributions to the WSDM program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />The broad impacts included training and development of the future generation of leaders and workforce in the increasingly critical field of search and data mining on the Web and the Social Web.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Here are a few comments from students who have received NSF support for attending the conference:</p>\n<p>* \"The Travel Award provides a great opportunity to support me in attending such a top venue and sharing my research.
