MobiCom is dedicated to addressing the challenges of mobile computing and networking and has emerged as one of the leading conferences covering networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support the convergence of mobile computers and wireless networks. MobiCom attracts world-leading researchers and practitioners to attend and present their work and participate in panels and keynote sessions. In addition to the regular conference program, MobiCom 2021 and 2022 will include a set of workshops, panels, research demonstrations, and a poster session that includes the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC).  \r\n\r\nThe NSF travel grant will encourage more students to attend the conference and avail the benefits of interacting with leading researchers in the areas of mobile computing and networking and get motivated by the high-quality research work and discussions in the conference. The travel grant program has a proven record of providing minority and underrepresented students the means to benefit from this educational experience. Participation in MobiCom is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, provides students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
