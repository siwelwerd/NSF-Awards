 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 8-week summer REU program for 8 students hosted by Hampton University is aimed primarily at under-represented minority students to conduct research centered around the broad theme \u201cMeasurement and Analysis of Atmospheric Properties.\u201d  REU students will work with mentors from the Department of Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, with support from its associated research center, the Center for Atmospheric Sciences. Research projects will include several broad themes. Satellite image analysis will be applied to the detection of flood waters on normally dry land and to the appearance and growth of harmful algal blooms in local rivers. Hampton University\u2019s NSF-funded observatory will be used to monitor the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn and Venus. Ground-based instruments will be used to measure atmospheric properties for comparison with satellite measurements. Students will participate in the collection of atmospheric measurements from a variety of instruments, apply fundamental data analysis techniques, develop basic research skills (literature review, instrument calibration, data validation, model fitting, coding), and participate in a research team to develop collaboration skills (active listening, leadership, communication, delegation). The students will also receive professional development training including topics such as paper and proposal writing, peer review, and oral presentation skills. This REU program, by instilling confidence in under-represented minority participants in their pursuit of STEM degrees and careers, will enhance the contribution of Hampton University to the diversification of the nation\u2019s STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nHampton University has state of the art atmospheric instrumentation.  Instrumentation available includes  met sondes, O3 Sondes, Cimel Photometer, 48\u201d Mie-Ramen OPA DIAL, 48\u201d Mie-Ramen lidar, doppler lidar, scanning lidar, and Pandora Spectrophotometer.  Research topics students may work on are related to three major themes: 1. Satellite mission design, 2. Observational Analysis of Planetary Atmospheres, and 3. Critical analysis of aerosol measurements. Participants will have the experience enhanced by visits to The Virginia Air and Space Center and The Virginia Living Museum.  Mentors participating in the program will receive mentor training from the Hampton university Faculty Institute Program.  Graduate students will serve as near-peer mentors and receive training from the program director on responsible code of conduct for research and prevention of sexual harassment.  \r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
