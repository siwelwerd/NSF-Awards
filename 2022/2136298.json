 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel automated manner to drain abnormal accumulations of fluid in the abdominal body cavity. The proposed system seeks to progress visualization, sensor and algorithm technologies to semi-automate drainage procedures,  standardizing delivery of care and reducing the required clinical resources (personnel and required hospital equipment). Healthcare costs continue to increase in the United States (US). This trend, coupled with current and projected manpower shortages in the healthcare sector, is driving the relevant stakeholders to consider innovative solutions to appropriately manage healthcare costs while still providing high-quality healthcare to patients. While other sectors of the economy have greatly benefited from increased use of automation to improve efficiency and cost containment, for a variety of reasons, the healthcare sector is lagging in implementing these innovations in a systemic way. With this opportunity in mind, this Phase I STTR project aims to prove the feasibility of developing a unique, semi-autonomous robotic platform that will be adaptable to many medical procedures. As envisioned, the technology may lead to key advances, including improved patient outcomes and levels of care while increasing procedure/staff efficiencies, and reducing medical costs. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate a proof of concept for an integrated procedural unit for semi-autonomously performing paracenteses. The prototype system to be completed during this stage is comprised of an ultrasound probe, motorized anesthetic syringe, scalpel, and aspiration needle, and can be integrated into standard, commercially available robotic units. The algorithm will be developed using Bayesian indexing  based on ultrasound images to execute ascites fluid removal in both virtual and mechanical simulations. Based on the preliminary work done by the multidisciplinary team of medical, robotic, and artificial intelligence (AI)) experts, the company plans to create and test a compact robotic device with the required sensory and driving components. This robotic device will have multiple subunits arranged in a compact and innovative way, capable of accurately imaging and controlling various instruments essential for anesthetizing and then driving the necessary cannulas for fluid aspiration. The project objectives include: (i) design and manufacture of the robotic system, (ii) development of AI-driven segmentation of ultrasound images and optimization of needle placement, and (iii) design and implementation of control algorithms for safe and robust operation of the surgical robot.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
