 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cybersecurity is critical to the protection of computer systems and networks. Many businesses and organizations need to hire cybersecurity professionals to protect their cyberinfrastructure from persistent and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. Although the global cybersecurity skills shortage has fallen, the size of the workforce is still 65% below what it needs to be. This project will study how to create seamless continuity from the classroom to the cybersecurity workforce by integrating cybersecurity competitions and job-readiness modules into existing coursework and providing opportunities for students to apply cybersecurity skills learned in their courses in real-world settings. The project leverages a partnership with the Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC), a national non-profit entity with a presence in Orange County, to provide students with the opportunity to join the ITDRC and be involved with specific disaster pre-planning activities and potential disaster recovery efforts. \r\n\r\nThe project will create an incident response cybersecurity program aligned with critical business and federal requirements by integrating FEMA courses related to disaster response and incident command structure into existing coursework. Mapping the curriculum to federal standards will help position Santa Ana College to become a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD). Students will take part in in rigorous job-readiness and work-based learning that will result in employment through partnerships with committed industry and community partners. Project evaluation will consist of an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to provide a structured review of program implementation to ensure that the project is progressing as planned and to analyze the level of attainment of project objectives, targets, and goals. This project has the potential to increase program enrollment, retention, and completion of an Associate of Science Degree in IT Cybersecurity Operations, especially among students from populations underrepresented in the cybersecurity workforce. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
