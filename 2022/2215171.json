 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Ithaca College is acquiring an upgraded console and probe for a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support the research of Professor Scott Ulrich and colleagues Michael P. Haaf and Anna Larsen. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of polymer science, inorganic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry.  In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in the Chemistry Department at Ithaca College as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. This instrument enables increased diverse representation of undergraduate and high school students through established outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThe award of the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer upgrade is aimed at enhancing undergraduate research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as polymer, organometallic, and medicinal chemistry. The instrument impacts research focused on discovering polymers of intrinsic microporosity, and on the characterization of chiral lactide polymer catalysts. Other investigations include the synthesis of iridium and rhodium pincer complexes and medicinal chemistry targeting bacterial signaling enzymes and cancer cell metabolism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
