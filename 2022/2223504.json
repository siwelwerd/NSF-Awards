 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student registration for select students participating in the student support and mentoring program at The Nineteenth International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research (CPAIOR) that will be held in Los Angeles, California, June 20-23, 2022.  This is the premier, highly-interdisciplinary, international conference that brings together researchers from three distinct communities to exchange ideas. The student mentoring program is oriented on research and career development for students who are active within these communities.\r\n\r\nThe central activities of this conference include a master class to teach skills, opportunities for students to present and discuss their work with their peers, and interaction with an identified group of senior researchers for advice on Ph.D. research.  In addition, students will have access to invited talks and paper presentations. The student selection process emphasizes support to students who most need it, including those who lack other means of support. This raises the potential to bring in participants who might not have attended this conference due to lack of habit or resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. This event provides students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research and enables them to explore their career objectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
