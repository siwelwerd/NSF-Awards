 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to California State University, Chico to acquire a confocal microscope system for research and training of diverse students (39.4% from historically under-represented (HU) groups, 50.7% 1st generation college students, 55.4% women) at this Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). This award supports access to essential technology for competitive basic science research in rural areas north of Sacramento. The imaging technique increases visual resolution and contrast of a microscopic specimen through the capture of multiple two-dimensional images at different depths, and then reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure. Fluorescent dyes can further target specific structures and/or molecules in a cell, tissue, or organism. This technology will enhance undergraduate training in multiple classes within the North State educational community, and be used by Master\u2019s students for research projects. Usage will increase the depth of cellular/organismal/microbial learning, enhance technical skills, and facilitate multidisciplinary projects. Thus, students will be better trained graduates of the CSU system and competitive for jobs or PhD programs. The award also facilitates an increased capacity for faculty led high-quality publications and competitive funding proposals.\r\n\r\nConfocal microscopy is important to cellular science, but also has applications in other areas of the life sciences (microbiology, genetics, developmental biology), and in materials science (geosciences, engineering, physics). The award enables Chico State and other regional faculty to pursue novel approaches that investigate the role of cellular biomechanics in spinal integrity, geobiology, and animal-microbe interactions. On-site confocal microscopy will allow multidisciplinary approaches to understand genes and the related cellular mechanisms responsive to mechanical stimulation, and how the breakdown of these mechanisms leads to reduced spinal integrity. Confocal microscopy also provides non-invasive, high-resolution images of intact, living or minimally preserved specimens. Projects that look at either living fish embryos or anemone larvae demonstrate the ability to study adaptive changes during growth or symbiotic relations. The confocal microscope will also be applied in undergraduate and graduate projects that seek to characterize the bioavailability of marine iron regenerated by microbial species. Results from the novel research enabled by this award will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at local, national, and international scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
