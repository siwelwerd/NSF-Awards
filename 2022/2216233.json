 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant advances in science and technology have been made by discovering suitable properties of new materials. The Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) will allow the characterization of new materials being investigated for potential applications in food science, biomaterials, and electronic devices, which are essential to advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. The combination of several experimental techniques and automation in the PPMS results in a powerful research tool capable of providing the high-quality data needed to explore new classes of materials. This state-of-the-art instrument enables the research training of students and postdoctoral associates, benefits undergraduate and graduate engineering and science laboratory courses, and extends education outreach programs focused on materials research that are in place at Oklahoma State University. This project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). \r\n\r\nOklahoma State University (OSU) requests a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The Quantum Design PPMS is an open architecture, variable temperature, and magnetic field system designed to perform a variety of automated measurements. The instrument will have the following technical features: a PPMS system with a 9 Tesla magnet, DynaCool dilution refrigerator, modules for DC resistivity measurements, vibrating sample magnetometry, ac susceptibility/dc magnetization measurements, Van der Pauw measurements, horizontal sample rotator, heat capacity measurement system, thermal transport measurements, and the xyz piezo and optical multi-functional probe with a photoconductivity stage. This state-of-the-art PPMS will be used for research into a broad range of scientific challenges, including detection of hot electron injection across metal-semiconductor Interfaces, thermal property measurement of biomaterials, transport at the surface of pyroelectric materials, the impact of radiation on the electronic properties of materials for the Large Hadron Collider, radiation-hard electronics, and electronic properties of superconductive oxides and topological materials. Other research areas impacted include magnetic measurements of materials hosting skyrmions, gluten composites' thermal properties, and nanomaterials' characterization. To promote research and teaching and maximize multi-user access, the PPMS will have a high level of exposure and be available at a low cost to all OSU researchers and researchers across Oklahoma. This project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
