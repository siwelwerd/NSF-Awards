 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 7th Annual Meeting of Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematicians Central States Section (SIAM-CCS) will be held at the Stillwater campus of Oklahoma State University during October 1-2, 2022. The conference website is https://siamcss2022.okstate.edu/. The SIAM Central States Section (SIAM-CSS) was founded in 2014, and it serves SIAM members in eight central states in the United States, including Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The SIAM-CSS Annual Meeting has been held annually since 2015, with the primary goal of improving the development of applied and computational mathematics throughout all central states, as well as facilitating knowledge transfer and promoting interdisciplinary collaborations among applied mathematics and other disciplines in science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe SIAM-CSS annual conference series provides an important forum for applied and computational mathematicians from central states to present their latest achievements, communicate and exchange ideas, and enhance collaborations. It provides an excellent opportunity for researchers in all stages of their careers, especially early career mathematicians, to establish interactions with researchers from all over the U.S. and other countries. It is essential in stimulating research activities in relatively less developed states. As the first face-to-face meeting after the pandemic, the conference will bring vitality to the applied math community in the region and promote the development of the discipline. This NSF grant will solely support the participation of students, postdoctoral scholars, early career faculty, and underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
