 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction sector is a major contributor to the U.S. economy. It represents over 4% of the U.S. GDP, equivalent to 1.36 trillion dollars. Despite recent advancements, studies indicate that the construction industry is still one of the least computerized sectors compared to manufacturing, telecommunication, and retail industries. In line with this, the construction research community faces significant challenges when it comes to adopting new data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and techniques. Several factors, such as complexity and uniqueness of construction projects, the rapid pace of evolution of such technologies, and unfamiliarity of traditional construction faculty with such topics, cause this situation. As a result, it is crucial for researchers and academic experts to develop novel educational and training strategies to bridge such research skills gaps and strengthen construction research data literacy and digital fluency. This project addresses the above challenges faced by educators and researchers in construction engineering through the development of an educational and community engagement platform called CyCon (Cyber Construction). \r\n\r\nThe CyCon platform focuses on state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques and cloud computing solutions that serve CI (CyberInfrastructure) users, contributors, and professionals in the construction research community. The CyCon platform contains the following four training and educational components: (1) CI user resource modules, including modular learning coursework and course project libraries, to train CyCon users with basic and advanced CI research skills, (2) CI educator resource modules that provide novel strategies and online materials to efficiently train educators, (3) CI competition modules to help CyCon users practice and further advance their knowledge about AI/ML products and tools using real-world construction problems, and (4) CI crowdsourcing modules that provide a well-defined data pipeline using data warehouses to enrich construction datasets available for public use. The CyCon platform is designed as a sustainable educational and community engagement framework for the construction CI research community and is expected to significantly improve the learning and teaching experiences of CI users and educators at various construction programs nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
