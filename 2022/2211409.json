 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic insects emerging from rivers during the hatch provide a major source of energy and nutrients to many predators. The nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, that are contained in aquatic insects are an important food subsidy to terrestrial ecosystems.  However, insects are sensitive to and declining globally because of altered water availability, pollution, and temperature warming. Despite these widespread declines, little is known about how emergence may affect neighboring terrestrial ecosystems because the critical adult aquatic insect life-stage that allows energy and nutrients to be transferred from the aquatic environment to terrestrial consumers is sorely understudied in monitoring programs. This project investigates the role of a severe drying disturbance in regulating emerging aquatic insect hatches, in particular that of the salmonfly, which is a species of large aquatic insect in the stonefly order that is sensitive to global change. The researchers are evaluating how drastically reduced water flow from a dam gate failure influences salmonfly density, biomass, and emergence timing. A postdoctoral scholar and several undergraduate research assistants are being trained, a public survey on the topic of drought will be completed, and the research will be presented at a local festival in southwestern Montana. Public outreach will highlight the tight connections between water and land and the importance of emerging aquatic insects as a source of nutrients and energy to fish, birds, and mammals.\r\n\r\nThis project will make transformative contributions to our understanding of the shifting role and resiliency of aquatic-terrestrial linkages under anthropogenic change by contributing novel information about the influence of a pulse drying disturbance on the adult life-stage of aquatic insects. The research project investigates how a dam malfunction on the Madison River in southwestern Montana that resulted in a short but extensive drying event could change aquatic insect emergence compared to prior years.  The focal organism for the research is the giant salmonfly, which is an ecologically and culturally important aquatic insect in rivers in the Rocky Mountain West. The project will quantify salmonfly density and timing during emergence using field observations, laboratory flume experiments that manipulate drought conditions to assess salmonfly survival and movement, and simulations of different drying extents to quantify the influence of drought on export of nutrients from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. This project is one of the first to evaluate how global change alters nutrient cycles by changing aquatic insect hatches and severing ties between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project investigated the resiliency of these aquatic-terrestrial linkages to anthropogenic change by evaluating the influence of drying disturbance on the larval and adult life-stage of aquatic insects. We used field and lab studies to document how the rapid draw down of river flow associated with a malfunction of Hebgen Dam, Madison River, Montana in Fall 2021 altered giant salmonfly (<em>Pteronarcys californica</em>) survival, body sizes, and emergence timing. We collected data to compare the contribution of other aquatic insects to that of salmonflies in particular to better understand the value of this charismatic species to carbon flux coming out of rivers and onto land during the hatch. And we investigated how drought interacts with other stressors such as warming water temperature to regulate salmonfly survival, growth, feeding rates, and behaviors. For this project we completed two lab experiments, two field seasons of monitoring field work during summer emergence, and one survey of 50 anglers. Data from our efforts are currently being processed and analyzed. Our accomplishments for broader impacts range from training students to dissemination of findings through scientific and public presentations. We trained one early career researcher, three graduate students, three undergraduates or technicians, and one high school biology teacher. We presented our work at conferences or public seminars 12 times. We have one paper in preparation, with at least two more to be submitted to peer-reviewed journals in the future.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/16/2024<br>\nModified by: Lindsey&nbsp;K&nbsp;Albertson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2211409/2211409_10782973_1715885216133_Screenshot_2024_05_16_at_11.46.19__8239_AM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2211409/2211409_10782973_1715885216133_Screenshot_2024_05_16_at_11.46.19__8239_AM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Emergence\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2211409/2211409_10782973_1715885216133_Screenshot_2024_05_16_at_11.46.19__8239_AM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Emergence\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Salmonfly emergence</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael MacDonald</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lindsey&nbsp;K&nbsp;Albertson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Emergence</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2211409/2211409_10782973_1715885502423_Screenshot_2024_05_16_at_11.51.13__8239_AM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2211409/2211409_10782973_1715885502423_Screenshot_2024_05_16_at_11.51.13__8239_AM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Salmonfly larva\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2211409/2211409_10782973_1715885502423_Screenshot_2024_05_16_at_11.51.13__8239_AM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Salmonfly larva\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A salmonfly in its aquatic life stage</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael MacDonald</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lindsey&nbsp;K&nbsp;Albertson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Salmonfly larva</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
