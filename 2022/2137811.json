 "awd_abstract_narration": "This demonstration project builds and deploys culturally relevant computing curricula for Native Hawaiian M/K-8 students. By collaborating with existing programs and partners in K\u0101ne\u02bbohe, Hawai\u02bbi, including the Pacific American Foundation and Ke Kula Kaiapuni \u02bbo P\u016b\u02bb\u014dhala School, this project supports students in developing place-based education and Hawaiian cultural restoration practices alongside concepts of computer science. The project enables students to learn to program using the BBC Micro:bit, a pocket-sized computer with built-in sensors that can be programmed using Microsoft\u2019s Makecode interface. In learning how to program the BBC Micro:bit, students collect data using sensors, embedded systems, and wearables to support local natural resource preservation efforts. Students learn about integrating computing and sustainability at the Waikalua Loko I\u02bba, a Native Hawaiian fishpond and cultural landmark supported by the Pacific American Foundation, by engaging in culturally relevant curricula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project explores computing education curricula for Native Hawaiian students at Ke Kula Kaiapuni \u02bbo P\u016b\u02bb\u014dhala School, a Hawaiian immersion bi-lingual public school. This project employs concepts of practice-linked learning to facilitate an environment for students to explore the role of computing and cultural identity across various problem-solving activities and experiences. This demonstration project is a community-oriented effort that emphasizes student interaction between the environment and computing technologies. The ongoing goals of this project are to support a team of educators, curriculum developers, \u02bb\u014clelo Hawai\u02bbi language experts, and content specialists in curriculum and resource development. Furthermore, the project provides students with integrated computing opportunities during school, after-school, and summer activities, interweaving with existing place-based education at the Waikalua Loko I\u02bba. Lastly, the project promotes community collaboration by reflecting on experiences, working with an advisory board, and expanding online computing education resources for Native Hawaiian learners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
