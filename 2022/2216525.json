 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tree-dwelling (also known as arboreal) primates are masterfully adapted to life in the trees and should have little need to descend to the ground, yet arboreal primates have been observed using the ground more frequently than expected. Indirect observations of ground use (or, terrestrial behavior) among arboreal primates are becoming more common due to the increasing popularity of motion-activated cameras traps in wildlife research. This doctoral dissertation research project combines state-of-the-art remote sensing surveys, utilizes an extensive network of camera traps, and uses existing long-term data concerning food availability and weather to identify the influence of these aspects of ecology on the terrestrial behavior of arboreal primates. The research investigates where, when, which, and why primates descend from the trees to use the forest floor. The project also supports public science outreach and public data access. \r\n\r\nThis project combines novel data with over 5 years of existing ecological data sets. Novel data to be collected include measures of forest structure and connectivity from detailed 3D LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) imagery. Existing data sets include camera trap videos of primates on the ground, camera trap videos of predators, estimates of fruit availability, and weather metrics such as temperature and rainfall. The research focuses on multiple species in an arboreal primate community at an established field site. Primate terrestrial behavior is modeled using occupancy models, examining combinations of the data described above to determine the influence of these ecological variables on primate ground use. The results of this research have relevance for understanding the specific ecological conditions under which otherwise arboreal primates resort to using the ground. Additionally, this research can yield critical data for conservation science of arboreal primates. With primate habitats rapidly changing across the globe, having a better understanding of what factors influence primate ecological and behavioral flexibility, at both the species and community level, is crucial for successful conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
