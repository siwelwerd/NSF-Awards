 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This project will focus on learning about model based reasoning in science, and will develop, implement, study, and refine a 6-week climate science module for high school students.  The module will feature use of a web-based climate modeling application, and the project team will collect and analyze evidence of model-based reasoning about climate phenomena among students.  Scientists routinely use data-intensive, computer-based models to study complex natural phenomena, and modeling has become a core objective of current science curriculum standards. The project will provide new insights about student use of scientific models to understand natural phenomena, and advance knowledge about curriculum, instruction, and assessment practices that promote model-based reasoning among students.\r\n\r\nThis 4-year Design and Development project will examine use of a web-based climate modeling tool designed to provide non-scientists experiences with climate modeling in high school geoscience classrooms. A theoretically-grounded and empirically tested approach to design-based research, instructional design, and assessment development will be used in an iterative cycle of instructional innovation and education research to find answers to two research questions: 1) How do secondary students develop epistemic and conceptual knowledge about climate? And 2) How do secondary science teachers support student use of climate modeling application to develop epistemic and conceptual knowledge about climate?  Data associated with conceptual and epistemic knowledge, curriculum-embedded modeling tasks, interviews, and videorecorded observations of instruction will be used to study impacts of the new curriculum module on 55 high school science teachers and 3,000 students.  Project participants include students from low socioeconomic populations and other groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  The curriculum will also serve as a resource for an existing, online professional development course at the American Museum of Natural History that engages teachers nationwide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe High School Students Climate Literacy through Epistemology of Scientific Modeling (CliMES) project is a 5-year, mixed-methods, design-based research project to investigate use of a novel new high school curriculum using EzGCM (Easy Global Climate Modeling), a web-based climate modeling suite designed to provide non-scientists experiences with climate modeling. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) prioritize both scientific modeling and Earths climate system as central disciplinary ideas and practices for high school science. Project goals are twofold: 1) Enhance model-based teaching and learning about Earths climate system in high school classrooms and 2) conduct research to investigate model-based teaching and learning about Earths climate system in high school classrooms. The guide project research, we pose two overarching research questions: 1) how do students use EzGCM to learn about Earths climate system? and 2) how do secondary science teachers support students use of EzGCM to learn about Earths climate system?\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThe project is a direct response to calls for research on students participation in and learning about scientific practices, and how such learning is intertwined with their developing conceptual understanding of Earths climate system. It is grounded in theory and research on model-based teaching and learning, student learning about Earth systems, technology-enabled science learning environments, and reform-based science education in formal classroom settings. Project research has illustrated how students engage in model-based learning about Earths climate system using EzGCM, how and why teachers use the project-developed curriculum in particular ways, relationships between teacher practices and targeted student outcomes, the nature of the research-practitioner partnership underlying the project, and diagnostic characteristics of student assessment instruments.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThe project has directly impacted approximately 2500 high school students and 75 high school teachers. It has fostered partnerships between educators, researchers, and scientists across institutions of higher education, government agencies, and public school districts. Project resources, models, tools, and research findings have been shared widely, including 10 peer-reviewed publications, 25+ conference presentations, and a fully developed, 5-week curriculum module for high school science classrooms. An overarching goal of the project is to enhance climate literacy in tomorrow's global citizens. We sincerely hope, as do all involved in climate education, that classroom outcomes documented in this project translate into the real-world and that all project participants are better prepared to confront global climate change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CoryForbes\n"
