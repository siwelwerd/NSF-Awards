 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor structures essential for developing future nano-devices to form the backbone of quantum technologies including quantum computers, communication networks, and cryptography applications. These efforts may accelerate practical and commercial applications of quantum computing in material discovery, biology, pharma, logistics, optimization, cybersecurity, finance, and chemistry. For example, adequately scaled quantum computing may allow much faster development of vaccines by simulating the complicated biological processes involved in vaccine development. Achieving the promise of the second quantum revolution requires new tools and methods to address the scalability challenge in quantum computers. By solving this problem, quantum computers may reach their true computational power. The proposed effort seeks to address this key need by focusing on combining an integrated hardware solution with materials-focused technology to create a solution that may be used in quantum computers and quantum communication industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of hybrid nanodevices used in the generation of entangled photons through materials research combined with a compact and highly integrable hardware interface for control and measurement of qubits. This effort may help to solve one of the biggest challenges in quantum computers - scalability. More specifically, the proximity effects in two-dimensional materials with a focus on the superconductor-semiconductor interface is explored. The intended application of this approach is in the creation of high-purity, on-demand entangled photon sources for quantum information technology. This work adds a new dimension to existing efforts in studying proximity correlations by exploring interactions between Cooper-pairs and excitons across the van der Waals interface in a new class of materials system. This capability is combined with scalable control and measurement hardware that may provide a foundation for solving significant challenges of quantum computing and quantum communication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
