 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina A&T State University is acquiring a Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometer for multidisciplinary research and education. This instrument serves as a platform that will significantly elevate the capability for chemical analysis at North Carolina A&T State University and boost various fields of research and education, such as environmental remediation, analytical chemistry, nanomaterials, soil science, water resource engineering, biochemistry, 3D printing, nutrition, animal science, protein synthesis, food processing and fisheries. This award will engage numerous faculty members across the campus. The chemical analysis platform enabled by this instrument will be a catalyst for training students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM. Annually, a large number of postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school summer students are expected to use or be trained with the instrument. The instrument will participate in various outreach activities that promote a culture of scientific inquiry and reasoning in K-12 schools, community colleges, and the public.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina A&T State University is acquiring a Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometer for multidisciplinary research and education. This instrument will have the capability to quantify a wide variety of chemical compounds, such as new emerging environmental contaminants, biomolecules, etc. in a wide variety of matrices, including environmental media, plant and animal tissues, food, nanomaterials, etc. It serves as a platform that will significantly elevate the capability for chemical compounds separation, identification and quantification at North Carolina A&T State University  and boost various fields of research and education, such as environmental remediation and water resources, analytical chemistry, biological science, food chemistry, protein synthesis, soil science, nutrition, nanoplasmonic biosensor and energy harvest, food processing and fisheries, etc. This award will engage numerous faculty members across the campus. The chemical analysis platform enabled by this instrument will be a catalyst for training minority and other underrepresented students. Annually, a large number of postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school summer students are expected to use or be trained with the instrument. The instrument will be used in various outreach activities that promote a culture of scientific inquiry and reasoning in K-12 schools, community colleges, and the public. It will foster both new and currently existing research and educational collaborations with investigators from other nearby Universities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
