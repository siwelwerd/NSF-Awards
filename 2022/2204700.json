The workshop will consist of talks by leading experts on connections between categorification in representation theory, quantum groups, and quantum topology, as well as short talks by early-career participants. Participants will be introduced to exciting new directions in representation theory and topology, and will gain experience for future projects. The diversity of mathematical researchers and areas represented at the workshop will foster new collaborations and new research projects.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will address topics on link homologies, quantum groups, Hopf algebras, and categorification, as well as interactions of these subjects. Categorification, which is the central theme of the workshop and subsequent lecture series, has played an important role in several areas of modern mathematics, including representation theory and quantum topology. These events at the University of Virginia seek to foster communications between experts and students in these fields. By encouraging interactions with leading experts and exchanges of emerging new ideas, the workshop will provide a platform to further scientific advances and facilitate collaborations between two seemingly different fields. The workshop website is http://math.virginia.edu/ims/workshop-spring-2022.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
