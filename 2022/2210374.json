 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimal control of quantum systems is essential to the development of quantum computing technologies and fundamental experiments. Finding optimal control schemes requires minimizing an objective function over an overwhelmingly large phase space. To overcome this challenge, current techniques simply search for an optimal scheme by heavily truncating the search space. However, this is known to overlook faster and higher fidelity solutions. The aim of this project is to theoretically develop and experimentally explore a novel approach for designing optimal control schemes of quantum systems.  The success of this project will allow quantum physicists and engineers to design optimal control schemes better than those available today, thus enhancing the capabilities of existing quantum technologies and will boost development of high-fidelity quantum processors. In a broader sense, enhancing quantum computation capabilities will affect our ability to solve larger problems than currently possible in all areas of science and engineering.  In addition, the work will provide training to graduate students who will be involved in all aspects of the project, including research, collaboration and the dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nThe approach is based on a novel technique for calculating elements of exponentially-large matrices without the need to store prohibitive quantities of data. The team plans to further develop this technique and adjust it to the  settings of quantum optimal control in overwhelmingly large Hilbert spaces. Such settings arise when coupling an atom or qubit to a Bosonic mode, and are common in leading quantum technology platforms, such as Ions, Cavity-QED, and superconducting circuits. Specifically in the latter, a promising hardware-efficient approach for quantum computing is to encode the quantum information in the vast space of Bosonic modes. Searching within such a large phase space may prove to be crucial for this approach; and the versatility of this platform may prove crucial to understanding the theoretical scheme in a realistic setting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
