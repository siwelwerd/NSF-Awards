 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Miami University, located in Oxford, OH, will support the training of 12 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022- 2024. It is anticipated that a total of 36 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research in ecology, evolution, and environmental science is conducted in landscapes altered by human activity, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences and publish results in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Students will be equipped to generate creative and integrative approaches toward understanding global environmental issues, while also engaging in service that enhances environmental quality in their local communities. Assessment of the program will be done through the use of online surveys. Students, a significant proportion of whom will pursue graduate training in ecology and environmental science or will enter the environmental science workforce, will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThis program will create collaborative clusters of student-mentor pairs addressing environmentally relevant research questions related to Urban-to-Rural Gradients, Population Connectivity, and Ecosystem Services. Students will be empowered to conduct their own research projects, to integrate their research with the work of others, and to consider the larger implications of human domination of landscapes and the role of science in solving environmental problems. Enrichment activities will focus on professional development; environmental ethics and responsible conduct of research; service to the community, and interactions with diverse scientists from other institutions. Student applications are accepted from December-March and a diverse cohort of participants will be selected based on their academic record and interests in ecology, evolution, and environmental science process. Example research projects can be viewed at the program website. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.miamioh.edu/ecoreu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David J. Berg at bergdj@miamioh.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Michelle D. Boone at boonemd@miamioh.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
