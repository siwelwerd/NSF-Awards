 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued advances in micro- and nano-electronics require a fundamental rethinking in the approach behind device concept, manufacturing, architecture, energy efficiency, and modeling and simulation. For example, the use of deformation or strain, in particular dynamic strain, has remain largely unexplored. This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) Pivot award supports fundamental research to elucidate our understanding beyond static straining by bringing dynamic, high frequency mechanical resonances to strain engineering of atomically thin semiconductors. Dynamic strain modulated properties of these semiconductors will enable reconfigurable micro- and nano-electronic and photonic technologies. The advances made here are expected to impact the micro- and nano-electronics systems industry and facilitate the continuity of United States\u2019 leading position in semiconductors. As part of the award, the lead researcher will also receive training in design, fabrication, and characterization of high frequency small scale electromechanical systems as a visiting researcher at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Graduate students too will be exposed to JPL\u2019s collaborative environment and mentoring. Additionally, the award will be used to engage minority and women, veterans, and high school students in nanoengineering research via summer opportunities and field trips.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the knowledge gap in ultrafast strain engineering and dynamic strain-coupled properties of two-dimensional (2D), atomically thin semiconductors. Dynamically tunable, high frequency surface acoustic waves (SAWs) will be employed as a mean to modulating local strain in various 2D semiconductors. By pushing the SAW modulation frequency in GHz regime, the effects of dynamic straining or matched mechanical resonance and optical (lifetime of exciton) transition on optoelectronic properties will be investigated. Another focus of the research will be on the coupling of SAW with the lattice straining and local strain reconfigurability in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) semiconductors under different SAW patterns for modulated exciton devices. Multiscale, multiphysics modeling of dynamic straining will be used to build a comprehensive understanding of these dynamically reconfigurable local strain and strain-coupled optoelectronic phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
