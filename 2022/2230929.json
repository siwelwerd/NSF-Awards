 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological networks are critical tools for modeling and analyzing questions in systems biology, and computational network biology has grown into a subfield that combines biology, computer science, and modeling.  Scientific workshops are important for researchers to share their work and learn about cutting edge advances in the field, and the Seventh International Workshop on Computational Network Biology: Modeling, Analysis, and Control (CNB-MAC 2022) will be held in Chicago, Illinois, on August 7, 2022. This award will support conference travel for at least eight graduate students to CNB-MAC.  Students will gain firsthand knowledge of recent advances in computational network biology, which can have a long-lasting impact on their own research career. Students will also have the opportunity to present and discuss their own research findings, receiving feedback and mentoring from established researchers. New this year, CNB-MAC will have events to foster networking and collaboration among attendees. Attending CNB-MAC through travel support from this award will provide graduate students valuable opportunities to engage with the computational network biology community.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh International Workshop on Computational Network Biology: Modeling, Analysis, and Control (CNB-MAC 2022) will be held in Chicago, Illinois, on August 7, 2022.  The workshop will be held alongside ACM\u2019s Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, which is the flagship conference of the ACM Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics. CNB-MAC aims to provide an international scientific forum for presenting recent advances in computational network biology and boost the awareness of the importance of rigorous mathematical modeling in transforming big biomedical data into reproducible and meaningful scientific knowledge. CNB-MAC solicits original research papers that report new research findings that have not been published elsewhere, highlight abstracts that present advances in the field that have been reported in recent journal publications, and poster abstracts for rapid dissemination of the latest research results in computational network biology. CNB-MAC workshops are an excellent venue for young researchers working in computational network biology to share ideas and get involved in deep scholarly discussions, thereby ultimately contributing to the advancement of the field of computational network biology. This award will support travel to CNB-MAC for at least eight graduate students, providing essential networking and professional development opportunities for the travel awardees. Travel support can significantly reduce the financial burden for students to attend the conference, especially for students from institutions where their mentors are unable to pay for conference registration and travel.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
