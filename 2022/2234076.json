 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research projects produce various outputs such as software, code, data, and hardware. When these products are made available via an open-source license, anyone can publicly access, modify, and distribute them to others. However, ensuring that these products continue to remain useful over time can be a significant challenge. Additionally, organizations that maintain these open source products need to sustain themselves. Optimal management of an Open-Source Ecosystem can help ensure that the open-source product on which the ecosystem is based has maximum impact over the longest possible lifetime, while also minimizing potential security and privacy risks. As part of NSF\u2019s Pathways to Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program, this project will develop a training program to teach awardees the best practices necessary to ensure that their open-source ecosystems are secure and sustainable. Some of the materials that will be developed for the training program, such as case studies of successful existing projects and recordings of talks by experts, will be made available so they can benefit others beyond the program.\r\n\r\nAn Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) is a sustainable organization that enables the ongoing, collaborative, asynchronous development of an open-source product that may be based on data, software, and/or hardware, and that is designed to be publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable by anyone under an open-source licensing model. The primary goal of the POSE training program is to help enable participants sustain and maintain their open-source ecosystems.  This program has four intended impacts: 1) to help teams identify a relevant and sustainable OSE to match their research needs; 2) to define broad societal impacts for OSEs; 3) to develop and curate a set of best practices for building secure and sustainable open-source ecosystems for any open-source product; and 4) to amplify the reach and impact of materials through various outreach mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
