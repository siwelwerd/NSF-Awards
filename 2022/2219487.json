 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a collaborative reinforcement learning approach for multi-robot systems that ensures safety and is privacy-preserving. The approach enables robots to continuously learn and adapt to dynamic situations within the systems constraints. Moreover, this new approach ensures that the private information of the participating robots, such as identity and position, can be protected in collaborative tasks involving multiple participating robots. While the approach for multi-robot learning is general, it has application to intelligent transportation systems on roadways driven by autonomous and semi-autonomous cars and trucks.  A demonstration of this  approach is to be conducted in a full-scale test environment of a realistic urban setting.\r\n\r\nThis project combines model-based safety with model-free reinforcement learning to enable reinforcement learning's applicability to safety-critical collaborative multi-robot systems. It will first address single-robot reinforcement learning using a deep Koopman-based safety regulation for general nonlinear robotic systems to guarantee safety while retaining learning efficiency. The result will then be extended to multi-robot collective reinforcement learning where robots are deployed in shared, contested, or resource-constrained environments. By exploiting the inherent dynamics of collaborative learning, the project will also enable dynamics-based privacy protection for collected and shared data during learning. Different from conventional privacy mechanisms that either trade accuracy for privacy or incur heavy computation/communication overhead, the dynamics-enabled privacy approach can maintain learning optimality while incurring little computation/communication overhead. The algorithms and frameworks will be evaluated using both numerical simulations and experiments with real connected vehicles on real tracks. Results of the project will be used to enrich both graduate and undergraduate courses. The PIs will also use existing various on-going outreach opportunities to energize interests in STEM in K-12 students and community college technicians.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
