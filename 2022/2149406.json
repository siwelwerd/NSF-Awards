 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficacy rates for COVID-19 vaccines have received major attention in scientific journal articles and news media outlets. Further, many sources emphasize the high efficacy rates for the three vaccines with FDA or FDA EUA status in the United States. For example, the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine boasts an efficacy rate of 95% against the original strain of the COVID-19 virus, meaning that over the duration of a 3-month period in which 1% of the population without the vaccine contracted COVID-19, we could expect about 0.05% of vaccinated people to contract COVID-19 (95% lower). However, many lay people may not understand how vaccine efficacy rates are computed, and the 95% efficacy rate could be misunderstood to mean that 95% of vaccinated people will be protected from disease, implying that 5% of vaccinated people will become diseased with COVID-19. This project examines how lay people (such as patients) use health-related numerical information, sheds light on the basic cognitive processes underlying misuse of vaccine efficacy numbers and speaks to the broader question of how to present numerical health information in a way that lay people can understand and effectively use. The research identifies the degree to which different facets of cognitive processing (e.g., knowing how to use the mathematical formula, understanding the concept of relative risk reduction, and engaging in deliberation or comparison processes) act as facilitators to providing the normative response. Findings from the proposed research have the potential to foster informed medical decision making and patient agency. Understanding how lay people understand vaccine efficacy is highly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic when conversations about vaccine efficacy receive increased attention and interest from patients.  Given the strong association between perceived vaccine efficacy and vaccination intention, it is critical to identify and correct misconceptions in patients\u2019 understanding of vaccine efficacy statistics.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread discussion of efficacy rates for COVID-19 vaccines in scientific journal articles and news media outlets, but little is known about how well lay people understand vaccine efficacy, which entails a fairly sophisticated mathematical calculation. This research tests the prediction that lay people are lured by a plausible and computationally simple but incorrect calculation: post-vaccination risk of infection = 1 - efficacy. For example, the lure response would be that after receiving a 95% effective vaccine a person has a 5% risk of getting infected. Previous medical decision-making research demonstrates that patients, especially those low in numeracy, often have difficulty understanding numerical information, which has a consequential impact on their health decisions and health outcomes. Moreover, prior cognition research provides evidence of quick, intuitive responses that may be analogous to the lure response in the vaccine efficacy context. This series of studies investigates the extent to which laypeople improperly interpret efficacy and whether this misunderstanding is associated with individual characteristics such as numeracy, cognitive reflection, and scientific literacy. First, hypothetical scenario experiments are employed to better understand how lay people utilize information about vaccine efficacy. Scenarios that vary information about fictitious vaccines illuminate the extent to which lay people improperly understand efficacy (for example, by answering that a vaccine that is 95% effective means that 5% of vaccinated people will get infected). Additional studies test a tutorial designed to improve viewers\u2019 conceptual understanding of vaccine efficacy. Two versions of the tutorial differ in their emphasis on the mathematical formula vs. the concept of relative risk reduction, enabling a test of which of these facets is the major barrier to normative responses. Final studies examine a debiasing method that prompts participants to make an implicit comparison of disease risk between untreated and treated groups, testing the hypothesis that misunderstandings about vaccine efficacy stem from a failure to consider a comparison between a placebo group and a vaccinated group.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Further, with each new COVID wave or disease variant, scientists and laypeople alike generated new questions and concerns about what such efficacy rate statistics actually mean in the context of real-time disease risk. The reported experiments demonstrate a frequent misunderstanding about vaccine efficacy. Specifically, lay people commonly respond that 95% efficacy means that a vaccinated person has a 5% risk of contracting the disease. In our experiments we refer to this mistake as a \"lure\" answer. The lure answer is incorrect because in reality, a 95% lower risk is not equal to a 5% risk of getting sick: the risk of getting sick is actually 95% lower than what it would have been had the person not vaccinated. We investigated the information scenarios prompting this error and two different training interventions to try and help people calculate efficacy rates more accurately.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Our project aimed to address the question of how we can present numerical health information in a way that people can understand and effectively use. In our first study, we found that the tendency to interpret vaccine efficacy rates correctly or incorrectly depends on how the question is asked and how the medical statistics are presented. Participants in this study gave the correct response more often when doing math problems that asked them to calculate the efficacy rate (image 1). Here, they were given hypothetical numbers from a vaccine trial that told them how many subjects got sick in both the placebo and experimental groups: this type of question was called the \"efficacy\" task. In other questions, we informed participants what the efficacy rate was for a hypothetical vaccine, and asked them to calculate how many subjects got sick in the experimental group, based on the number of subjects who got sick in the placebo group: this type of problem was called the \"infection\" task. In this task, participants tended to give the \"lure\" answer discussed in the first paragraph.</p>\n<p>In our second study, we designed a tutorial that explained the definition of vaccine efficacy and how to calculate it (image 2). The tutorial involved several numbers in its examples. Our participants completed the same math problems as in the first study, except that this time, half of the participants saw the educational tutorial before they did the problems. The other half saw a different tutorial that had nothing to do with vaccine efficacy. We found that the \"numeric\" tutorial (called this because it involved numbers and equations) helped participants calculate efficacy rates that were correct more often. The numeric tutorial also helped the participants in the infection questions (that asked how many subjects in the hypothetical trial group got sick), but in a different way. Instead of giving the correct answer more often, participants who saw the tutorial were less likely to give the frequent \"lure\" answer that control participants often gave in the infection questions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In both the first and second studies, we found that participants with higher numeracy skills gave correct answers more often. Numeracy reflects the ability to plug in provided numerical values correctly in the context of an equation or formula such as the one used to correctly calculate the efficacy rate. Viewing the numeric tutorial benefitted higher numeracy participants the most, as one might expect. We think that this is because the numeric tutorial trained participants to use the relevant numbers and formula, and in order to benefit from this training, participants needed to be comfortable with numbers in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our third study aimed to test a new tutorial (in addition to the numeric tutorial, image 3) to help low numeracy participants calculate the correct answers more often. We created a \"conceptual\" tutorial that showed participants visual graphics meant to represent healthy and sick subjects in a hypothetical vaccine trial (image 4). The idea was to communicate that vaccine efficacy rates come from a comparison between unvaccinated and vaccinated groups in the trial. However, we again found that after seeing the conceptual tutorial, higher numeracy participants gave more correct answers than lower numeracy participants.&nbsp;Although low numeracy participants who saw the conceputal tutorial did give correct answers more often than those who did not see it, this improvement was not dramatic compared to high numeracy participants.</p>\n<p><span>The COVID-19 pandemic led the public to&nbsp;think differently (and more often) about vaccine efficacy than they did before the pandemic. Our work is important because it provides a new way to help the public understand what efficacy means in the context of decisions surrounding vaccination and other medical treatment options. Gaining a better understanding of medical statistics, like vaccine efficacy rates, is likely to help people make more effective choices about their health.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/06/2024<br>\nModified by: Alison&nbsp;Butler</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321312191_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_11.05.31__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321312191_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_11.05.31__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321312191_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_11.05.31__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of numeric tutorial from Study 2.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Butler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Butler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321352024_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_10.23.29__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321352024_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_10.23.29__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Image 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321352024_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_10.23.29__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Image 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of quantitative tutorial from Study 3.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Butler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Butler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321530320_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_11.09.54__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321530320_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_11.09.54__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Image 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321530320_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_11.09.54__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Image 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of conceptual tutorial from Study 3.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Butler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Butler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321272123_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_10.50.21__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321272123_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_10.50.21__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2149406/2149406_10781508_1709321272123_Screenshot_2024_02_28_at_10.50.21__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of question from efficacy rate task.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alison Butler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Butler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
