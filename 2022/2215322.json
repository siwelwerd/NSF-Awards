 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Valparaiso University is acquiring a Raman microscope to support the research of Professor Paul Smith and colleagues Jon-Paul McCool and Julie Peller. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, engineering, and geography. Raman microscopy integrates a standard optical microscope with a laser that is used to scan the surface of a sample to generate a chemical image over the field of view. The laser wavelength is used to probe the vibrational properties of sample and produce a spectrum that identifies chemical components in the material. This is a powerful analytical tool for identifying chemical composition qualitatively and semi-quantitatively of various materials. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. Research and research training advances science and benefits society in timely topical areas such as sustainability, water control and management, and solar energy.\r\n\r\nThe award of the Raman microscope is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in those focused on chemistry, energy, and sustainability. Research focuses on the analysis and quantification of microplastics in water as well as of mineralogical variations in natural waters. In addition, other investigations focus on mapping how electrons permeate battery cathodes. It also assists in determining how atom vacancies influence solar-to-fuel reactions in fixed-bed reactors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
