The 2022 JMM session will be held in Seattle, Washington and the 2023 JMM session will be held in Boston, Massachusetts. The EDGE program was founded in 1998 to improve retention and completion rates for women and minorities in graduate programs and increase diversity in the mathematics community. The 2022 and 2023 sessions will showcase the research of women who are affiliated with the EDGE program.\r\n\r\nThe session provides a platform for women in all areas of mathematics to present their research findings and generate ideas for new research techniques and directions. Opportunities to strengthen participants\u2019 network of women mathematicians and establish new mentoring relationships with other women affiliated with the EDGE program are provided. The session benefits the larger mathematics community by increasing the visibility of women in mathematics by highlighting their research work, thereby creating opportunities for recruitment and retention of women in mathematics. Further information about the EDGE program can be found at the link below.\r\n\r\nwww.edgeforwomen.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
