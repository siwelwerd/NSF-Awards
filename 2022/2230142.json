 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for participants of \u201cSemi-annual Workshop in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics at Penn State\u2019' for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, to be held at the Mathematics Department of Penn State University.  The first of these meetings will take place on November 3-6, 2022. This represents the Penn State half of the Semi-annual Workshop in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics, co-organized for the last 32 years by the dynamics groups at Penn State and University of Maryland; the Maryland half is held each spring. The workshop is devoted to recent developments in dynamical systems and their numerous applications to related fields in mathematics such as algebra, geometry, and number theory.\r\n \r\nThe goals of this conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and progress in the theory of dynamical systems viewed in a broad sense, and in related fields; to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics community. Special efforts are made to attract women participants as well as members of underrepresented groups. The workshop is intended to provide a focus of activities and a meeting place primarily for mathematicians from the Northeast region of the United States working in dynamical systems and related topics, including the strong groups at Penn State and University of Maryland; and a forum for both young and established researchers from this region to help exchange ideas with each other and their counterparts from around the world. Conference information will be available at: https://science.psu.edu/math/research/dynsys/workshop\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
