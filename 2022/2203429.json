 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for a delegation of US-based early-career mathematicians to attend the conference \u201cHyperbolic groups and their generalisations\u201d in Paris, held June 20-24, 2022. The conference is part of a series of conferences and lectures in the \u201cGroups Acting on Fractals\u201d thematic trimester at Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, which is one of the major events in the field of geometric group theory in year 2022. The conference invites a range of speakers of different career stages and arranges several discussion sessions aiming at creating a conductive collaboration environment. The grant will allow the supported US-based mathematicians to learn about important recent development in the field, to communicate their research results and exchange research ideas with their European colleagues, and to spark new research collaborations. Special effort will be devoted to identify and support members of groups under-represented in mathematics who will benefit from attending the conference.\r\n \r\nThe study of Gromov hyperbolicity is a central topic in geometry group theory, and has deep connections in geometry, topology, dynamics, and logic. In recent years, several important properties of hyperbolic groups were established, together with an explosion of new theories aiming at identifying traces of hyperbolicity in a highly non-hyperbolic setting. This leads to new angles of looking at hyperbolicity, as well as many new connections to other subjects. This conference will bring together prominent researchers in geometric group theory and neighboring fields and feature talks given by leading experts on recent major development of hyperbolicity and its generalizations. The conference will cover several recent major advances on the geometry of groups acting on Gromov hyperbolic spaces, as well as feature a variety of connections between Gromov hyperbolicity with topics in random walks, logic, higher Teichm\u00fcller theory, and geometric measure theory. This conference will also disseminate knowledge to the broader mathematical community by hosting all the talks for the conference digitally. For more information, see the conference website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/6577/overview.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
