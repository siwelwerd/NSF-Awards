 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to support a number of US-based students for attending the 2022 version of the  annual IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) with the intention of exposing them to the discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in emerging issues in the area of Circuits and Systems research. Participation in this symposium is considered an important part of the graduate-school experience of students in computer engineering, providing the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. The support will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would otherwise not have the experience. This student-travel support will also facilitate the development of promising graduate students, and will thus indirectly also help train the workforce of the future in the important area of computer engineering. Women and underrepresented groups will be given due consideration for receiving support through this grant.\r\n\r\nThe International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) for more than 50 years has been the premier conference where emerging trends and novel concepts of Circuits and Systems research have been explored. The 2022 version of this annual conference will return  to the US soil in Austin, TX after 5 years. The 2022 edition of this conference will address key trends and challenges in the area and includes Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Tutorials, Panels, Special Sessions. The conference committee has set up adequate evaluation criteria to select qualified students from a pool of applicants formed via open advertisement. While the requested funds will primarily be used for supporting graduate students, the committee may also consider a small number of undergraduate applicants in order to better reach a diverse population of potential researchers in this field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     These Student Participation Grants provided an opportunity for 26 deserving students to share their research results with peers, to interact with their counterparts by attending technical presentations and workshops/tutorials  presented by experts in the field, and to interact with recognized leaders in the greater circuits and systems community.  Included in the group of recipients were 8 female students and two under-represented minorities.  Competition for these grants was keen with a large number of deserving applicants from which the recipients were selected.           \n\n       Unique to ISCAS 2022 was inclusion of video files (.mp4 format) from all presentations in IEEE Xplore.  IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)  is the world?s largest professional organization and Xplore, the publishing arm of IEEE, is one of the largest and most respected publishers of technical materials in electrical engineering, computer science, and electronics.     ISCAS 2022 was the first major conference to include .mp4 files as part of the archival record in Xplore.   This broadly expands exposure of the additional information conveyed in oral presentations beyond those in physical attendance during oral presentations to a dramatically larger audience comprised of a large number of engineers around the world that did not have the opportunity to attend the conference.   To put this in perspective, students at most major universities around the world and engineers at most of the major technology companies across the globe now have archival access to the ISCAS 2022 video files from the participation grant recipients whereas those that have direct access to the oral presentations at the conference is a subset of those that register for the conference.\n\n       The technical program of ISCAS 2022, the 55th meeting of this conference, was generated by selecting 798 papers for presentation from 1230 submitted manuscripts.  These 1230 papers were subjected to a critical double-blind peer review process.  There were 1998 individual reviewers which provided a total of 4844 reviews which corresponds to an average of 3.94 reviews per submitted manuscript. The international exposure that grant recipients received was evidenced by the wide geographic distribution of authors at the conference which represented 51 countries with contingents from Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America in addition to a large number of participants from the United States.   \n\n     Grant recipients had the opportunity to participate, in person, in their choice 4 of 20 tutorials that were presented on a range of emerging topics by some of the world?s most respected experts in the field.  As conference registrants, they also had the opportunity to view recorded versions of all 20 tutorials at the conclusion of the conference. \n\n     Grant recipients provided testimonials about their experience at ISCAS 2022.  The following testimonial from one of the recipients is typical of the feedback that was received.\n\n     \"I also had great discussions with conference participants in the related areas. I got the opportunity of learning new trends and emerging technologies in the VLSI domain. My participation in ISCAS 2022 inspired me with new ideas and new friends to discuss my research and possibly collaborate with them.\"\n\n    Broader impact of participants included participation in the Wi-CAS (Women In Circuits and Systems) part of the conference program that focused on identifying outreach activities that are effective at enhancing ethnic and gender diversity in the circuits and systems field in particular and, more generally, in  STEM disciplines.  The topic of the Wi-CAS program for ISCAS 2022 was Navigating the Professional Virtual/Hybrid/In-Person World which was particularly timely in view of the dynamics and uncertainty associated with the transition from a  pre-pandemic to a post-pandemic working environment.  Broader impact included the technical contributions reported by grant recipients and the discussions and interactions they experienced that will lead to future contributions to the field of semiconductor devices and the products and applications that depend upon semiconductor devices as the underlying electronic backbone.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randall L Geiger"
