This meeting brings together scientists, students, and others in the GEOS-Chem modeling community to exchange information that will inform and stimulate fundamental research in the modeling of atmospheric composition with links to climate dynamics, biogeochemistry, and air quality.\r\n\r\nGEOS-Chem is an open-source global 3-D model of atmospheric composition used actively by over 160 research groups around the world, including over 50 research groups in US universities. Guidance for model management is provided by a GEOS-Chem Steering Committee including 15 US university professors. International GEOS-Chem meetings have been held every two years and are major events for the global atmospheric chemistry modeling community, with about 250 attendees and a very broad range of topics. Applications of GEOS-Chem span a very wide range of atmospheric composition problems including oxidants, aerosols, carbon gases, stratospheric chemistry, mercury, persistent organic pollutants, and others. GEOS-Chem links with climate and weather models for studies of chemistry-climate-ecosystem interactions, chemical data assimilation, and air quality forecasting. Oral presentations by early-career scientists and graduate students are prioritized at GEOS-Chem meetings, providing for many a first opportunity to present their work in front of a large international audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
