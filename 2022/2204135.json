 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Michael Pante at the Department of Anthropology and Geography of Colorado State University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the importance of bone marrow to the evolution of our human ancestors and the rise of hunting large animals for food. New technology will be applied to analyze bone breakage patterns related to marrow procurement from modern collections of broken animal bones as well as several zooarchaeological collections that are important for our understanding of human origins. Subsistence underpins human economics, and both the introduction of large animals as a food resource and hunting represent dramatic shifts in subsistence that had profound implications for human social behavior such as cooperation, conflict, and cognition, and thus, major impacts on our evolutionary history.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to test the role of bone marrow as the avenue by which early humans began using large animal food resources and its influence on the rise of the Human Predatory Pattern. Among primates, the Human Predatory Pattern (HPP) is the uniquely human behavior of hunting animals that are of equal or larger body size. Evolution of the HPP involves two key innovations: active hunting and exploitation of large animal food resources (LAFRs). The inclusion of LAFRs in the human diet and the HPP may have set the stage for humans to become super-predators, and even precipitated the origin of our genus, Homo. Yet, the mechanism through which this behavioral pattern evolved is unclear. This project will leverage new technological advances in 3D scanning, digital characterization, and machine learning, combined with traditional methods, to analyze bone breakage patterns and test the recently proposed hypothesis that the HPP derived from scavenging large animals for in-bone nutrients. This hypothesis predicts that early humans were breaking bones for marrow prior to other forms of butchery. This hypothesis will be tested by taking a diachronic approach that compares signatures of bone modifications made by early humans. Should the evidence confirm a transition in human exploitation of LAFRs through time, this would support the hypothesis, indicating that the rise of the genus Homo must be interpreted through the lens of scavenging for in-bone nutrients as the precursor to the HPP. This project comprises substantial intellectual merit, both within archaeological sciences but also more broadly in any field where 3D object shape is used in research. First, it will advance our understanding of human evolution by testing a major hypothesis associated with the assembly of modern human behaviors. Second, it will advance knowledge of human-carnivore interactions between 3.6 Ma (Late Pliocene), 1.8 Ma and 0.9 Ma (Pleistocene), the earlier time period having received little attention in this regard. Third, this project will develop methods of data extraction using 3D models that are effective for machine learning applications and broadly applicable to many other archaeological and paleontological assemblages. Fourth, this work extends collaborations among mathematicians, computer and data scientists, and paleoanthropologists to create innovative technological tools to enable researchers (within and beyond anthropology) to easily integrate their expertise with reliable and replicable mathematical approaches to research on objects. Finally, this project will create an extensive open-access database of research-quality 3D models and datasets that will facilitate future research projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is called the Human Predatory Pattern (HPP). This project investigates when and how early hominins transitioned to hunting large prey -- a fundamental shift in human evolution. The current scientific consensus is that the HPP evolved, as evidenced by stone tool cut marks on fossil animal bones, over one million years after the appearance of terrestrial bipedality, when the hominin lineage began to spend more time walking on two legs on the ground than climbing in the trees. Yet how an ape without carnivorous anatomical adaptations evolved to hunt animals larger than themselves, in competition with real carnivores (lions, hyenas, etc.), has been hard to explain.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Evidence of bone breakage from hominins using hammerstones to access brain tissue and bone marrow suggests an adaptive scenario which would help explain how the HPP actually evolved. This project tests a hypothesis for the existence of an initial, pre-HPP evolutionary phase in which early hominins extracted nutrients from in-bone animal resources from scavenging opportunities after the larger carnivores had removed the flesh. Hammerstone percussion of bones to extract these nutrients would have provided a dietary edge to these hominins in a novel terrestrial habitat, while also providing incidents of accidental hammerstone breakage, with its resulting sharp edges, that could have inspired the use, and subsequent intentional creation, of stone tool cutting edges to slice meat from more fleshed carcasses. This scenario suggests a succession of adaptive strategies from extracting in-bone nutrients from abandoned carcasses, to seizing carcasses from larger carnivores before the meat had been eaten, to hunting. Instead of the HPP being a sudden inexplicable evolutionary invention, it would be understood as a contextually specific, gradual process of behavioral evolution.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This project addresses key gaps in research: searching for evidence of bone marrow exploitation prior to evidence of stone tool butchery, analyzing evidence across time scales to identify changes in animal exploitation patterns, and addressing the issue that current methods of bone analysis are quantitatively insufficient to determine the agent of bone breakage (hominin or carnivore), lacking the required accuracy and degree of detail. This project applies advanced 3D imaging, machine learning, and computational modeling to develop new, quantitative methods for analyzing bone breakage patterns, improving our ability to distinguish between hominin and carnivore modifications with greater precision, thereby overcoming prior limitations of qualitative assessments.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This postdoctoral project began with identifying three hominin paleoanthropological sites that span the proposed chronological window for the evolution of the HPP, namely&nbsp; Laetoli (3.6 Ma), FLK 22 (1.8 Ma), and HEB Bed IV (0.9 Ma) in Tanzania. The primary goal in the first year was to 3D image a reference collection of agent-specific experimental bone breaks (hominin vs.carnivore, of &gt; 2,000 specimens) to be used as a model for interpreting the paleoanthropological collections.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>After four months of research in Tanzania, all 3D models had been completed from the sites of Laetoli and HEB Bed IV. Then in August 2022, the PI was sexually assaulted by the curator of the National Museum of Tanzania who tried to extort sex in return for a permit to export her data back to the US. The PI left the data in Tanzania and fled the country within hours of the assault. The professional relationship with the original host institution, Colorado State University, became untenable due to the institution's continued partnership with the Tanzanian museum where the assault occurred. This created a conflict of interest. The PI successfully pivoted her work, per her approved \"Change of Scope\" and transferred to the University of Minnesota as the new host institution. The rescoped project focused on advancing computational methods for imaging bone fragments and mathematically modeling the effects of erosion on bone fragments during burial which could prevent determining the agent of breakage.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The technological and methodological advances developed in this project -- particularly in automated scanning, erosion modeling, and machine learning -- have broad applications not only in anthropology but also in forensic science, cultural heritage preservation, and environmental sciences. For example, this project developed advanced methods for scanning hundreds of bone fragments using micro-CT and automatically turning them into 3D models, enabling the creation of high-resolution 3D models for thousands of objects at minimal cost (~1.00 USD per object). Furthermore, this project developed a mathematical model that holds promise for understanding erosion patterns on bone fragments. The open-access datasets and protocols developed in this project make 3D imaging and analysis tools widely accessible to researchers, educators, and students. This project has had significant broader impacts by engaging students, educators, and museum professionals in digital modeling and computational approaches to anthropology.
