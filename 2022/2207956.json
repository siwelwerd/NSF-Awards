This is the fourth such conference hosted by the  FAU College of Science. The conference aims to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations in data science and artificial Intelligence for scientific discovery. It is anticipated that the interactions fostered by this conference will lead to cross-disciplinary collaborations as well as new ideas needed to accelerate progress towards a better understanding of the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence in the context of fundamental and applied physics applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
