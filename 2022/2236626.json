This workshop will bring together representatives from these companies and a mosaic of educational institutions including leading R1 institutions, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Hispanic-Serving institutions (HSIs) to identify actionable ways for companies to engage in the NSF solicitation development process earlier, large cross-sector research needs (grand challenges), and the potential to form multisector consortia to catalyze chemistry research in areas of societal-level need. The workshop is slated to take place in Fall 2022 in the Washington, DC region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
