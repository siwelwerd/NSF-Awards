 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical part of providing high quality services over the Internet is optimizing the performance of the underlying networks.  With the rise of data analytics and machine learning, network providers have been able to steadily improve the user experience.  However, as anyone who has waited a long time for a webpage or video to load knows, there remains a need for ever-better network service.    This project tackles this challenge and breaks new ground by applying a different form of machine learning to networking that could potentially offer significant benefits.  Here, the goal is answering what-if questions -- i.e., given recorded data of an existing deployed system, what would be the performance impact if we changed the design of the system (e.g., deployed a new video streaming algorithm)? Answering what-if questions of this nature is known as causal reasoning, which considers the effect of events that did not occur while the data was being recorded. Widely used machine learning (ML) tools (e.g., off-the-shelf neural networks) are inadequate for causal reasoning since they merely capture correlations in collected data. This limits them to predictions that pertain to how a deployed system with an existing design performs in the future, and they incur biases when faced with \"what-if\" questions. Other approaches such as Randomized Control Trials may be disruptive to the performance of live users. This project aims to significantly increase the user experience of Internet services, while making these services cheaper to operate (cost savings that can be passed on to consumers), by allowing operators to ask what-if questions about new networking algorithms on passively collected networked data.\r\n\r\nThis project will bring together network systems, machine learning, and causal inference. More specifically, this project will develop: (i) Causal dependency graphs for real-world networking case studies, and approaches for causal adjustments that consider the ease of measurement in networking, estimator variance, and accuracy of predictions; (ii) Novel approaches to infer latent variables through network models, and through instrumentation to collect additional data that can serve as proxies for these latent variables in a manner that does not impact live users; and (iii) Techniques to bridge ML techniques for inferring latent variables and modeling the proposed changes, with unique challenges posed by incorporating network models. The ideas in this project can be more generally applied in many networking and machine learning domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
