 "awd_abstract_narration": "People fare poorly when they are unable to remain in contact with close others, as has become clear from pandemic conditions of social isolation. The positive effects of routine physical contact between friends, family members, and relationship partners often are taken for granted, but the importance placed on physical contact was brought into focus when social distancing kept people physically apart. This project focuses attention on the unique benefits of everyday affectionate physical contact. A primary aim of this project is to test why physical contact is beneficial for individuals and their relationships. What are the psychological effects of affectionate physical contact that differentiate it from verbal expressions of affection? This research tests how physical and verbal affection influence the mental models people hold (beliefs about whether they are worthy of love and care and whether others are supportive and trustworthy) and their couple identity (whether they think in terms of \"we\" and \"us\"). Further, this program of research assesses resulting behavioral changes that enhance individual and relationship functioning. A second aim of this project is to test how initial differences in people's mental models modulate the psychological effects of physical and verbal affection to determine who benefits (and perhaps who does not benefit) from affectionate physical contact. Understanding the unique psychological processes underlying physical versus verbal affection \u2013 how and for whom effects occur \u2013 will provide a foundation to help couples enhance their relationships and personal well-being.\r\n\r\nThis program of research uses a multi-method approach combining nonexperimental (ecological momentary assessments, observer-rated discussions) and experimental designs to identify the unique consequences of naturally occurring physical affection and a weeklong physical affection intervention. The mechanistic model guiding this research posits that a) physical affection uniquely encodes a state of security into existing mental models and uniquely fosters self-other overlap between partners, which b) enables people to enact behaviors that enhance their relationships and their personal well-being. This project incorporates cutting-edge measurement and analysis strategies to assess immediate and long-term consequences of physical affection. An ecological momentary assessment component captures daily levels of physical affection and self-other overlap. Moment-to-moment analyses of couple discussions reveal associations of physical affection (continuous observer ratings of duration and intensity) with secure mental models (time-linked continuous affect ratings of felt security). Additionally, the consequences of the physical affection intervention are being evaluated using sensitive and objective measures, including an implicit measure of attachment security that captures changes in mental models and observer ratings of constructive relationship behaviors that occur in guided couple interactions. Finally, this program of research examines who may or may not benefit from physical affection by analyzing the significant portion of people who believe and expect that others cannot be trusted (avoidantly-attached individuals). A significant component of this project is dedicated to providing opportunities for students to develop methodological and analytical expertise. Students receive direct training on designing, conducting, and analyzing multi-method studies that combine different measures, designs, and assessment timeframes. In addition, the project supports the development and dissemination of scaffolded resource toolkits that help undergraduate students produce independent research proposals. Ultimately, this project advances knowledge on fundamental aspects of how people think about and navigate their close relationships, and it can inform effective and scalable interventions to protect and enhance personal and relational well-being.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
