 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a hemorrhage-control training device.  As uncontrolled bleeding remains the leading cause of preventable death from trauma, effective hemorrhage-control training may be the difference between life and death for a trauma victim. Though existing training programs have been successful in reaching large groups of people across the globe, these training programs are limited by the use of unrealistic training models. The proposed technology, while remaining portable and affordable, is designed to realistically simulate a hemorrhagic emergency. For institutions who educate the public, their students, or their employees on hemorrhage-control techniques, this technology may offer better training without increasing training time. As interest and mandates surrounding widespread hemorrhage-control training beyond the healthcare setting continue to expand at the local, state, and national levels, it is imperative that trainees are provided with a realistic training experience to ensure that they are prepared to act in a real-life hemorrhagic emergency.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, affordable, and realistic hemorrhage-control training device that utilizes real-time biofeedback mechanisms to model a physiological response to application of proper hemorrhage-control techniques. Though hemorrhage-control training models exist, they are not feasible for use in widespread training due to high costs. Research suggests not only that current training programs lack realistic simulation, but that this shortcoming may compromise the effectiveness of these programs on preparing individuals to perform life-saving skills in a real-life trauma situation. The most commonly reported elements of hemorrhage-control training programs that lack realism include demonstration of bleeding, the actual pressure needed to stop a bleed, the stress and urgency of a real-life emergency, and the reaction of a wounded patient to intervention. To address these shortcomings, the proposed technology may include a traumatic wound with pressure sensors that read pressure applied directly to the wound as well as through application of a tourniquet. Upon application of adequate pressure, hemorrhage cessation will be demonstrated. Additionally, a speaker will be embedded to simulate a patient\u2019s reaction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
