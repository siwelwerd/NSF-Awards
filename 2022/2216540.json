 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite efforts to broaden participation in technology majors at US universities, classroom learning environments and career engagement opportunities have not evolved to meet the unique needs of increasingly diverse student bodies. The voices and experiences of women, Black and Hispanic / Latinx students are commonly underrepresented in existing curriculum and instructional practices, which reinforces inequities that impede their learning, engagement, and persistence in technology majors. This demonstration project aims to create first-year learning experiences reflective of the knowledge and skills of minoritized students. The project team will pilot a novel approach for overlaying inclusive teaching practices on the well-established Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement and Evaluate (ADDIE) course design model. Instructors at Penn State\u2019s College of Information Sciences and Technology will participate in Inclusive ADDIE workshops to redesign the first-year course and develop a digital badging credential. The expected outcomes of these faculty development activities include first-year learning experiences that foster classroom spaces that welcome and support diverse learners, strengthen student-teacher interactions, and incentivize and reward students\u2019 exploration of technology career resources and opportunities. \r\n\r\nBroadening participation initiatives tend to focus on recruiting new students while overlooking current students as an essential asset in reaching diversity goals. The proposed study uses Inclusive ADDIE, an action-oriented framework, to reimagine a first-year course that enhances the learning experiences and career exploration opportunities of minoritized students majoring in IST. The project team will implement and assess two scalable and reproducible faculty development interventions that consider intersectionality and facilitate modifications to curriculum and instructional practices to bolster students\u2019 persistence. The Inclusive ADDIE framework has transformative potential concerning more significant theorizing of race and ethnicity related to inclusive pedagogies and course design. This project also offers a repeatable methodology and curriculum for inclusive pedagogy and course design that supports the persistence of minoritized students in technology majors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
