 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the variability in the upper atmosphere is important because it will help us better understand the space weather effects in that region.  The HAARP facility can generate artificial heating in the atmosphere to enable the study of the variability of the atmosphere, the energetic electron distribution, and how the HF radio wave propagation would be affected.  The project will lead to discovery and advance our understanding of space weather effects.  The National Research Council emphasized the potential of ionospheric modification techniques (artificial heating) for mainstream aeronomy research.  The \u201cArctic Research in the National Interest\u201d also highlighted the strategic and technological significance of HAARP facility and argued in favor of an expanded role in basic research.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project.  There will be a summer school and a topical symposium annually.  These activities in the past have proven to be excellent in student recruitment and retention.  \r\n\r\nThis project will use ionospheric modification methods at the HAARP facility in Alaska to investigate four scientific topics: 1) the diurnal and day-to-day variability of the neutral atmosphere, 2) the energetic electron distribution and controlling factors, 3) the detection of upper-hybrid waves, and 4) the HF radio wave propagation and scintillation through a program of experimental and theoretical research.  Using novel experimental modalities, this work will measure neutral winds that are difficult to measure by other means, employ a novel method to infer the suprathermal electron distribution, and apply ionospheric modification for general space weather studies.  The team will field and operate several diagnostic instruments to detect the effects and will run heating campaigns at HAARP semiannually.  The diagnostic instruments will be available to other HAARP investigators for use to increase the scientific impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
