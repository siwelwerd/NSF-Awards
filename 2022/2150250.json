 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. This REU program has both scientific and societal benefits, integrating research and education. This project will train undergraduate students from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) with research opportunities and support their placement in graduate studies programs. This 8-week summer program provides eight students from underrepresented backgrounds with training in research methods as well as research and mentorship opportunities. Students will focus their research on US political economy and mobilization. Often referenced as the key or conduit for the revitalization of US democracy, students will examine the context, drivers, and consequences of mobilization and engagement in civic life. Despite its importance, mobilization faces numerous barriers and challenges that threaten the continuity of political engagement and the overall health of US democracy. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to deepen the demographic and methodological diversity of graduate school applicants. Demographic and methodological diversity are essential for advancing knowledge and understanding issues broadly related to attitudes, behavior, and institutions connected to public policy and the provision of public services. This project also engages in research on strategies to 1) close the quantitative literacy gap in the social sciences, 2) improve student preparation for graduate studies, and 3) enhance their academic success. This program will develop open-access pedagogical materials to improve quantitative skills and support the pedagogical training of faculty and researchers involved in undergraduate methods teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
