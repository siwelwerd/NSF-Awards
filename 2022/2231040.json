 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computing has shown capabilities far beyond traditional computing paradigms and has great potential to be the next scientific breakthrough propelling scientific and economic developments for the society in the near future. Quantum processors are experiencing a major boost since technical giants entered the quantum race. The computing capability of a quantum processor scales with the number of qubits that can be embedded and interconnected. However, it is still quite remote for a single quantum processor to perform large-scale computing tasks. To bridge the gap between limited computing capability of a single quantum processor and high-demands of computing tasks, quantum processors are interconnected by quantum links in synergy with classical links, which forms a quantum computing system. In such a system, a subset of quantum processors can be entangled to form a virtual quantum machine with a large number of qubits to boost the computing capability. This project systematically investigates the fundamental and challenging issues in entanglement in quantum computing systems.\r\n\r\nThe project explores unique features and techniques of quantum to boost efficient entanglement in quantum computing systems. It focuses on following closely coupled tasks: (1) investigate the entanglement routing problem in broader quantum system settings in terms of multiple quantum measurement metrics; (2) design novel entanglement routing algorithms with both high efficiency and theoretical guarantees; (3) design optimal system topologies to further boost the entanglement efficiency, cooperating with the routing algorithms; (4) conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation through extensive simulations and emulations by quantum simulators. The outcome of this project will not only greatly boost entanglement efficiency in quantum computing systems theoretically, but also facilitate future practical quantum computing applications that rely on the cooperation of a set of entangled quantum processors. It will have a profound impact on scientific and economic improvement in the society. The project trains graduate students and promotes the participation of female students in electrical and computer engineering. The important findings of this project will be disseminated to the research community and industry by way of conferences, journals, and website access.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
