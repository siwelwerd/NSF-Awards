 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of novel virtual technologies is enabling a new era of connection between humans at a global level. This has led to a new wave of growth in the popularity of video-based teams, and it has become essential to develop productive, successful, and healthy human interactions using smart devices. Additionally, the migration to digital platforms that is further spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased barriers to interactions, diversity, and inclusion. Due to the strong likelihood that videoconferencing (and thus virtual meetings) will continue for a long time after the pandemic ends, there is a need to develop more inclusive and equitable environments that support productivity and collaborative creativity in diverse virtual team contexts. The project will design a novel Smart Meeting Assistant (SMA) as a transformative solution to efficiently enhance video-based team innovation. The high-level goal of SMA will be to facilitate objectives such as: (i) collaborative creativity; (ii) convergent thinking by clustering of ideas from similar topics; (iii) feasibility of generated ideas through video-based meetings; (iv) reducing bias in video-based teams. The project team includes researchers from a rural-serving institution and a Hispanic-serving institution in Texas, and a mid-sized public institution in Colorado. Participants of pilot studies include students from diverse backgrounds and workers from real-world settings. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project will use a mixed methodological approach to examine human interactions and features of virtual-meeting platforms that influence user\u2019s social and cognitive wellbeing. Design of SMA paves the path for bringing the recent advances in deep learning and data analytics, supported by psychological sciences with a strong focus on human factors and ergonomics, to design virtual sociotechnical systems facilitating collaborative innovation without jeopardizing the social and cognitive wellbeing of video-based teams. First, the project team will develop a broader understanding of how people perceive creativity, wellbeing, and equity during virtual group interactions. Subsequently, an expanded pilot study will explore ways in which fundamental meeting features (e.g., speaking time, duration of meeting) and socio-cognitive variables (e.g., degree of knowledge sharing, satisfaction) statistically interact to predict collaborative creativity, wellbeing, and equity in diverse (gender and multicultural) video-based teams. Finally, the research team will carry out the foundational work to design a social-cognitive training module assisted by a Smart Meeting Assistant to facilitate collaborative creativity, wellbeing, and equity in the video-based environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Awarded in Fall 2022, it involved an interdisciplinary team from Tarleton State University, Texas Wesleyan University (#2222764 &ndash; PI Jonali Baruah, Co-PI Lauren Coursey), and the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) (#2222795 &ndash; PI Jugal Kalita).</p>\r\n<p>The research aimed to examine virtual meetings (VM) to evaluate their impact on productivity and collaborative creativity, and develop a training module to foster creativity, equity, and inclusiveness. It also sought to develop a software prototype to analyze group communications and provide discreet feedback to the host, offering real-time and predicted insights to facilitate equitable, productive, and creative discussions.</p>\r\n<p>The initial work in Fall 2022 focused on observing and recording VM group brainstorming sessions. Activities included tracking group communication, the number of turn-taking instances, speaking time, and quantity of ideas generated by individuals and groups during a 30-minute session. Additionally, two-hour VM interviews were conducted with ten randomly selected participants. Using a transcendental phenomenological approach, this study revealed key themes regarding preferences for virtual meetings, including convenience, autonomy, personalized learning environments, and discipline.</p>\r\n<p>In Spring 2023, we organized a full-day (6-hour) design thinking workshop to engage the university community in creating an ideal dashboard for VM teams. While the broader goal was to impart knowledge in the community regarding virtual team effectiveness and productivity, as well as the latest research in the area, there were team activities to engage the community and brainstorm ways to enhance virtual team interactions and productivity. &nbsp;Experts from Dell Technologies, and the UCCS delivered lectures on advancements in virtual group productivity and well-being, followed by interactive Q&amp;A sessions with attendees.</p>\r\n<p>The workshop gathered 55 participants from fields like computer science, management, and psychology, who collaborated in small groups to design posters of their ideal VM dashboards. Groups pitched their ideas to a panel of experts, with incentive prizes awarded for the best concepts. Key suggestions, such as measuring speaking time, using AI for summaries and topic analysis, and tracking participants&rsquo; engagement, helped inform the development of a prototype to improve virtual teamwork.</p>\r\n<p>Machine learning experts of the team began developing a prototype to summarize meeting discussions, focusing on capturing speaking time, turn-taking, topics covered, and the number of non-repeated ideas generated. Using topic modeling, the program aimed to automatically determine the topics discussed, count non-repeated ideas, and summarize meeting transcripts based on convergent and divergent thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the psychology expert team conducted experimental studies over the spring, summer and fall of 2023 and spring and summer of 2024.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experiment 1 compared VM with virtual brainwriting. Involving 157 participants, this study assessed how perceived diversity and two virtual idea-generation methods (VM brainstorming and virtual brainwriting) impacted creativity. Brainwriting groups outperformed VM groups in both the quantity and originality of ideas, suggesting that virtual brainwriting may enhance innovation and productivity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experiment 2 collected brainstorming data from teams using various meeting modalities (face-to-face, brainwriting and VM) in presence and absence of distraction (one person in the group multitasking unbeknownst to others) to assess the collaborative creativity across various modalities. The findings revealed that distraction mostly reduced the quantity of ideas generated in virtual brainwriting groups.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experiment 3 focused on training inclusive practices in virtual teams. A sample of 159 students worked in small groups within VM settings, with multicultural, single-culture, or neutral (control) conditions. The groups trained in a paradoxical frame (to foster inclusivity) generated more and more original ideas compared to control groups, highlighting the benefits of inclusive practices in virtual environments.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Study 4, an interdisciplinary effort combining lab and machine learning data, was conducted by the machine learning and psychology teams. In the first phase, the machine learning team utilized video clips from Experiments 1, 2, and 3 to develop a machine learning-based coding method using topic modeling. This method categorized ideas generated during virtual brainstorming sessions and achieved 90% agreement with human-coded data, validating its accuracy and effectiveness. In the second phase, an experiment tested creativity in structured versus unstructured virtual brainstorming. Data from both machine and human coders showed consistent results, further validating the topic modeling method. While task structure had little effect on thinking, unstructured groups generated higher-quality ideas. These findings suggest that organizations could adopt the topic modeling approach to efficiently categorize ideas, saving time in transcribing meeting communication and assessing productivity.</p>\r\n<p>The findings from this collaborative research were presented at multiple national and international conferences. Throughout the grant period, our research engaged students and faculty members from 4 institutions (Tarleton State University, UCCS, UNT, and Texas Wesleyan University) in one or more initiatives. In addition to the impact above, the research generated four conference presentations, one invited presentation, three manuscripts under review, and one manuscript under preparation.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Jonali&nbsp;Baruah</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735507067613_DEsign_thinking_workshop--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735507067613_DEsign_thinking_workshop--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Design Thinking Workshop Recruitment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735507067613_DEsign_thinking_workshop--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Design Thinking Workshop Recruitment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Recruitment Drive</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonali Baruah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonali&nbsp;Baruah\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Design Thinking Workshop Recruitment</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506580234_Design_thinking_workshop_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506580234_Design_thinking_workshop_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Design Thinking Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506580234_Design_thinking_workshop_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Design Thinking Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Small groups engaged in the design thinking workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonali Baruah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonali&nbsp;Baruah\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Design Thinking Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506450685_Design_Thinking_Workshop_2--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506450685_Design_Thinking_Workshop_2--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Design Thinking Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506450685_Design_Thinking_Workshop_2--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Design Thinking Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students brainstorming in the Design Thinking Workshop conducted in Spring 2023</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonali Baruah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonali&nbsp;Baruah\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Design Thinking Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506933197_Hybrid_group_in_Design_thinking_workshop_5jpg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506933197_Hybrid_group_in_Design_thinking_workshop_5jpg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A Hybrid Design Thinking Group\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2222764/2222764_10833290_1735506933197_Hybrid_group_in_Design_thinking_workshop_5jpg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A Hybrid Design Thinking Group\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A hybrid group (face-to-face and video-based) in the workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonali Baruah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonali&nbsp;Baruah\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A Hybrid Design Thinking Group</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
