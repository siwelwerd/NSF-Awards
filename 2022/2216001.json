 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a table-top Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) system at Texas A&M University-Commerce (A&M-Commerce) for research and education. The SEM system allows us to characterize various sample systems by nano-size imaging and element analysis. The instrument greatly impacts on-campus research activities, leading to increased student involvement in faculty research projects. A&M-Commerce is a public, primarily undergraduate university. Educating the next generation of engineers and scientists is the primary goal of all faculty members of Science and Engineering. Meaningful research experience is provided with state-of-the-art scientific instruments. The SEM is used as an excellent training tool for students who want to pursue a career in STEM fields. In addition, the SEM is used for university outreach activities for community college students in summer research and local high school students with demonstration of nano imaging.\r\n \r\nThe SEM is capable of imaging objects below 10 nm resolution with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The instrument is used in four major research areas: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Construction Engineering. (1) Interface morphology in multilayer organic semiconductor films is investigated for basic research in optoelectronic applications in an organic semiconductor physics lab. SEM imaging reveals the interfacial contact properties of films of perylene diimide derivatives on inorganic indium tin oxide substrates. (2) Hydrochars from hydrothermal conversion of contaminated reeds are activated as supports of Pd-Ni/Cu bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes which are intermediates to manufacture critical chemicals/medicine. SEM is used to relate the surface properties of hydrochars to the activity, selectivity, and stability of hydrogenation reactions. (3) Biomass quality for pyrolytic conversion is determined by total cellular lipid content.  Photosynthetic efficiency upgrade coupled with Carbon/Nitrogen balance disruption is a major strategy for an effective photosynthetic biomass production; with a conceptual basis of lipid storage being an intracellular carbon and energy. SEM imaging provides an important innovative mechanism of monitoring cellular contents and composition changes of storage molecules. (4) The microstructure of concrete with cementitious materials is studied by SEM imaging. Fracture surfaces are analyzed to determine the mode and mechanism of failure of concrete with different components such as fly ashes, slag cement, silica fume, rubber, fibers, and recycled aggregates. The SEM also yields complementary information via its EDS capability,  enabling sub-micrometer investigation of the material\u2019s structure and composition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
