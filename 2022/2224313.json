 "awd_abstract_narration": "The torque of gas turbine engine rotors is a critical parameter that reflects the structural health status, powering efficiency, and system dynamic performance of the engine, however, the high temperature environment makes the torque monitoring extremely challenging and most existing torque sensors will not operate normally.  In this proposal, we will investigate a new type of torque sensor that could operate in high temperature (900o C) gas turbine engine environment. A series of fundamental research topics will be addressed in this project such as the configuration of the sensor, sensor materials, sensing mechanism and experiment test. Once developed successfully, the sensor will enable a better control of the gas turbine engine resulting in higher energy efficiency and better safety factor. In addition to the impact to gas turbine engine industry, the sensor will also have significant impacts on the power efficiency of vehicle internal combustion engines, sensing and control of coal-fired and nuclear power plants, monitoring of jet engines, aerospace propulsion systems, hypersonic vehicle engines and gas drilling monitoring. Furthermore, this project will substantially benefit the university through new course development, as well as research mentoring for graduates, undergraduates, and K\u201312 students. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to achieve real time measurements of rotor torque of gas turbine engine to improve the engine power efficiency and system dynamic performance. As a step towards this goal, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel Curved-shape Surface Acoustic Wave (CsSAW) sensor for the in-situ/real-time torque and temperature measurement of rotor shaft in harsh environments (900o C). This sensing system monitors the dynamic torque and local temperature of the rotor shaft in a harsh environment, evaluate the kinematic performance, and prevent earlier failure by detecting abnormal torque distribution. The research will be conducted through the following approaches: (1) Fundamental study and research on the surface acoustic wave propagating along curved surface; and (2) Investigation of a novel torque/temperature sensing mechanism, and (3) Experimental test in a mock-up high-temperature gas turbine engine environment. The successful completion of this project will generate a new type of sensor that will find numerous applications in engine industry, flexible electronics, aviation industry, flexible electronics, and gas drilling industry. The interaction of the universities and the world\u2019s leading power-generation industry at different ends of the research spectra will guide the fundamental research to solve this critical industry need and enable accelerated implementation of the developed knowledge to generate immediate industry impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
