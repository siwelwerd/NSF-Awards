The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project aims at understanding how microbes growing in desert soils can use chemical interactions to obtain vital nutrients and withstand the extreme stress of desert ecosystems. Microorganisms living in desert soils include bacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens. Most research attention has focused on photosynthetic bacteria and algae, as well as nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These microbes provide a source of nutrients such as carbon sugar and ammonia nitrogen, respectively, to the entire community. However, the role of fungal species in these communities is still unknown. This work aims to increase understanding of desert microbial communities by determining the role of these fungal species, which is believed to include providing melanin for increased ultraviolet and stress resistance for the whole community. This research will help provide new knowledge that will make it possible to use these microbial communities to perform soil metal removal, increase agricultural soil nutrients, retain soil moisture in droughts, and prevent desertification of non-desert ecosystems.\r\n\r\nBiological soil crusts (or soil crusts) are microbial communities that form biofilms on the surface of nutrient-deplete desert soils. It is hypothesized that the microbes residing in the soil crust engage in transient interactions akin to that of a lichen symbiosis, to obtain nutrients and survive extreme abiotic stress. To investigate this hypothesis, novel microbial species isolated from a soil crust will be used to: 1) show that non-lichenized melanized fungi can establish mutualistic interactions with bacteria and algae; 2) observe how fungal melanin affects microbes from the soil crust, to determine if melanin can be considered a \u201cpublic good\u201d for abiotic resistances and used as a carbon source; and 3) identify metabolites produced and gene regulation differences during multi-species cultures to determine how these microbes interact. The fellow has additional goals to improve both representation and experience in undergraduate research by 1) recruiting undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups and 2) developing a monthly basic lab techniques workshop to provide free lab experience to all undergraduates. Additional use of funds from this fellowship will be put towards increasing collaborations with fellow researchers in this field by developing a virtual conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our research aimed to determine if melanized fungi (aka: black yeast fungi), algae, and cyanobacteria taken from desert soils could be grown together in media lacking sugars and protein sources (nitrogen sources) vital to survival. Then we aimed to determine how they exchange nutrients and what nutrients they are exchanging, to determine how they survive via symbiosis in nutritionless desert soils.</p>\r\n<p>Previously, we isolated melanized fungi (melanin being the dark pigment that is produced by organisms, including humans, across the domain of Eukaryota for protection against the Sun&rsquo;s UV rays), algae, and cyanobacteria from desert soils for new species discovery for this project. Because we were working with melanized fungi, we knew they were resistant to conditions such as UV light, heavy metals, and low water availability, but these fungi are incapable of making their own nutrients in a place such as a desert or a brick wall where they are also found. Algae and cyanobacteria are both capable of performing photosynthesis, which takes atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and converts it into sugars, releasing these sugars into their environment. Cyanobacteria are also unique in that they are capable of a process called nitrogen-fixation, which takes atmospheric nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>), and converts it into ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>) and amino acids. Therefore, we hypothesized that the fungi were using their melanin to provide algae and cyanobacteria with protection from stressful conditions such as UV light, low water availability, and extreme temperature fluctuations, in exchange for the sugar and nitrogen that the algae and cyanobacteria produced.</p>\r\n<p>To test our hypothesis, we grew the fungus, algae, and cyanobacteria together in media containing no sugars or nitrogen sources, such as proteins and amino acids. This would require the fungus to rely solely on the algae and cyanobacteria to produce the sugar and nitrogen it needs to grow. Additionally, we created an albino form of our fungus by removing the gene responsible for melanin production in our fungus. With this, we discovered that melanin was required for the successful symbiosis of fungal-algal-cyanobacterial tri-cultures in nutritionless media (Figure 1). Without the melanin, the microbes could not form clumps, which would indicate that the cells are physically attached to each other, which is essential for the exchange of nutrients. Our tri-cultures with the melanized form of our fungus, however, were successful in performing symbiosis with the algae and cyanobacteria, forming extensive clumps and continuing to survive for over 50 days (Figure 1). Since our fungus is capable of secreting melanin into its environment when provided with amino acids, we believe that it is doing this in response to amino acids produced by specifically the cyanobacterial partner (Figure 2). We can now apply this knowledge to agricultural and desertification efforts by either making our fungus produce melanin and using that extracted melanin as a soil protectant, or we can add our fungus, algae, and cyanobacteria to soils to allow this natural process to occur to both provide nutrients to the soil and provide melanin protection to the microbes and plant roots.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to our scientific efforts, we aimed&nbsp;to improve the overall undergraduate experience in laboratory training and techniques and increase participation in STEM by recruiting undergraduate researchers from various backgrounds. To achieve these additional goals, we developed and implemented five workshops dedicated to teaching undergraduate students about basic lab techniques, which were free to attend for the students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These workshops were taught monthly each semester, and students who attended them appreciated learning techniques not taught in their lab courses. We also recruited undergraduate mentees for our lab by utilizing the internal programs: First Year Research Experience (FYRE), which is a federally funded program across the US that connects first-year students who are eligible for the Federal Work Study program with research labs; and TRIO, which provides research opportunities to first-generation students. The four undergraduate mentees recruited from these efforts have been with our lab for 1-4 years. They are given their own independent research projects, allowing them the opportunity to develop critical scientific skills for future job prospects. Our mentees have presented their work at local and national level conferences, and are involved in published manuscripts they contribute to.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/27/2025<br>\nModified by: Erin&nbsp;Claire&nbsp;Carr</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209217/2209217_10839113_1743113982253_Hypothesis_only--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209217/2209217_10839113_1743113982253_Hypothesis_only--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209217/2209217_10839113_1743113982253_Hypothesis_only--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visual representation of our findings.
