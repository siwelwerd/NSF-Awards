 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a new state-of-the-art high-throughput computing cluster for researchers across the 24-campus Penn State University system.  The cluster is composed of 10 AMD EPYC nodes, each with 128 cores and one A40 Nvidia GPU. Researchers in the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos and the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, priority users for the cluster, use this computer cluster to: study the universe by analyzing data to find ripples in space called gravitational waves; investigate novel ways to track down the universe\u2019s missing matter called dark matter; and search for planets around other stars.\r\n\r\nThe new computing cluster improves access to computing for all Penn State researchers in the hopes of accelerating the pace of discovery across a broad spectrum of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math through projects engaging the Penn State \u201cResearch Innovation with Scientists and Engineers (RISE)\u201d CyberTeam (NSF OAC-2018299). The cluster is connected to the Open Science Grid bolstering the fabric of national cyberinfrastructure that supports competitive US research through sharing resources across universities. Penn State also plans to use this resource for annual summer schools for students focused on data analysis, computing, physics, and astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
