 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) named Dr. Daniel \"Dan\" B. Larremore, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado Boulder as a 2022 Alan T. Waterman Award recipient. \r\nDr. Larremore is recognized for his unparalleled interdisciplinary research in the field of computational epidemiology and high impact work in the emerging field of data science. His research combines the development of advanced computational methods with their application to produce new scientific understanding about important societal problems. His innovative research combines mathematical models with complex social and biological systems to advance not only the forefront of science, but also help shape policies that have enormous real-world impact.\r\n\r\nDr. Larremore's interdisciplinary work combines mathematical models with complex social and biological systems to advance the forefront of science and help shape policies that have enormous real-world impact. Dr. Larremore is also actively engaged in studying the structure and dynamics of the scientific enterprise itself, in the interdisciplinary field called the \"science of science,\" which sheds new light on the drivers of scientific discovery, from the structure of faculty hiring markets to productivity and career trajectories. Dr. Larremore is committed to making science more inclusive through his actions as a collaborator and mentor, with rigorous academic work that builds an evidence base for quantifying and breaking down barriers to broadening participation in academia.\r\n\r\nDr. Larremore received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from University of Colorado Boulder (2012) and holds an undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers Institute, leads the Larremore Lab, and is affiliate faculty for applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is also external faculty for the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he was a postdoctoral fellow investigating the epidemiology and genetic networks of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, from 2012-2015. He was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute (2015-2017).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
