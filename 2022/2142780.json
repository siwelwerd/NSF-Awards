 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing universal computing curricula of Computing-As-Literacy at three different higher education institutions. Literacies such as careful reading, cogent writing, and compelling presentation serve many professional paths. However, Computing-As-Literacy has not been universally covered in science and engineering curricula. This project will develop and pilot new computing curricula at three Southern California colleges and universities. Every student at the three institutions will experience the new computing curricula, regardless of students\u2019 backgrounds and academic majors These curricula will explore whether and how computing-as-literacy can benefit all students, institutions, and STEM fields themselves. \r\n \r\nIn this project, three Computing 1 courses will be developed, piloted, and assessed for all undergraduates at three institutions. Similar to Composition1, Computing1 will not be a one-size-fits-all but a foundation-building-for-all course. Computing1 will be as varied, diverse, and creative as the three host institutions. The proposed curricula at the three different institutions will serve as role models for other colleges and universities nationwide to build their own universal computing curricula of Computing-As-Literacy, in support of their own distinctive missions and identities. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
