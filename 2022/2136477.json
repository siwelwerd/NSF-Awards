 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is an affordable and sustainable solution for onsite water reuse. The need for better water efficiency and reuse technology is growing quickly. Driven by unsustainable water use and rapid population growth, groundwater aquifers across the United States and around the world are drying up as environmental change causes water scarcity and drought. For almost one billion people worldwide, water scarcity is life-threatening. This project will develop a natural water treatment system that cleans household greywater for safe reuse in the home and garden, reducing total household water consumption up to 40% and simultaneously providing an attractive outdoor plant amenity. The treatment system will use compact, modular containers that can be quickly deployed and easily scaled for any size home and anywhere water infrastructure is expensive, scarce, or compromised. The system will remotely monitor water quality and system performance to ensure safety and reliability. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop a novel ecological treatment process that combines the biological systems of natural wetlands and the purifying properties of volcanic soils to clean and recycle household greywater for safe reuse in the home and garden. The system will use embedded sensors to remotely monitor water quality and system performance to ensure safety and reliability. The project tests a variety of plant species and natural substrates to maximize functional and aesthetic value and to improve tolerance to harsh climates and shade. Innovative management strategies, such as microbial inoculation and recirculating flow, will be tested to improve system health and treatment efficiency. This project will optimize treatment performance to meet regulatory standards. It will also assess improved treatment of common greywater contaminants such as toxic chemicals, heavy metals, cleaning products, fats, oils, grease, and urine. In addition to greywater treatment, alternative water treatment applications, such as nitrogen removal for rural septic systems and urban stormwater runoff, will be explored.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
