 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the relationship between coastal flooding and human migration. The study uses custom sensors to detect floods at high spatial resolution, integrating the data on flood frequency with measures of individual intentions, capacity, and actions regarding relocation. Community partners will identify flood-prone areas for the sensor network and guide the development of a user-friendly real-time website for flood information. The goal is to provide new insight on the impacts of floods on coastal communities and how migration may unfold in the future as sea levels rise. This information can be used to develop strategies that support resilient, sustainable coastal communities as the climate changes.\r\n\r\nWhile sea level rise is projected to dramatically reshape coastlines around the world, many questions remain about how individuals and communities will respond to more frequent minor flooding, punctuated by extreme storms. Smaller floods, such as those caused by particularly high tides, are difficult to detect, limiting our understanding of how people experience and respond to such events. This project deploys a novel sensor network to detect floods of all sizes. The sensor data will be used to assess the effects of flooding on migration intentions and behavior. Household surveys provide information on migration intentions, capacity, and the social, psychological, and financial context in which migration decisions are being made. Migration behavior is measured using administrative records. Overall, this project expands knowledge about the effects of sea level rise on coastal residents and the role of migration as a response measure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
