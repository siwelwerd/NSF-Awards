 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum physics and Einstein's General Relativity (GR) describe nearly all known physics quite successfully.  However, physicists conjecture that there exists a theory of everything that would unify these two theories.  One popular approach of late is to identify features of such a unified theory that could result in experimental signatures or evidence of new physics in sensitive experiments and observations.  Fundamental principles of GR such as the lack of any special direction in space (isotropy of space) could be violated in proposals for a unified theory of physics.  The PI will investigate new types of signals for the breaking of isotropy of space that could be measured in sensitive observations of astrophysical systems like pulsars and measurements of the ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves.  This award will support undergraduate research opportunities in theoretical physics.\r\n\r\nThe Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP), a vital foundation of GR, includes the spacetime symmetry called local Lorentz symmetry.  Some candidate models of quantum gravity contain the possibility that minuscule violations of spacetime symmetry may occur in nature.  Generic violations of spacetime symmetry are described using an effective field theory framework.  The PI will study the effective field theory framework, seeking solutions for signals for spacetime-symmetry violations in gravitational wave observations and other astrophysical systems like pulsars.  Researchers involved in precision tests of GR, in particular gravitational wave tests, will find motivation and additional areas in which to search for novel effects and new physics beyond GR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the PI, undergraduate students supported by the grant, and collaborators worldwide published articles on gravitational wave tests of GR, and short-range tests of gravity in the laboratory. \n\nFirst, the article on gravitational waves was a new analysis of making use the many observed gravitational wave events to search for possible tiny violations of Lorentz invariance.  For gravitational waves, these signals would manifest as a larger time difference between the two polarizations of gravitational waves, and dispersive effects in the signal.  The paper, published in Physical Review D in 2023, found no significant evidence of Lorentz violation, an placed limits on 16 independent quantities describing how Lorentz symmetry could be broken for gravity.  This was done in a particularly thorough way for the first time, incorporating the modified equations directly in the software code used to analyze the gravitational wave signals (from the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration data).\n\nSecond, the PI and several undergraduate students studied possible Lorentz violations in gravity.  An article, published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity in 2023, details a new kind of signal that experimenters with state-of-the-art short-range gravity apparatus, can measure.  This was the first signal to be calculated from an equation solved exactly instead of using perturbation methods.  This paper is expected to offer motivation for experimenters to analyze their data to look for a new kind of signal beyond GR.\n\nImpacts of the proposal also include mentoring undergraduate students (including female students and minorities- typically underrepresented in physics).
