KDD is an annual conference that presents the world's premier research in data mining. In the past, the total number of KDD participants has been in excess of 3000. The conference covers topics in the data mining lifecycle, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications. The conference will also focus on related areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data management, and information retrieval. The selection committee will select recipients of the support based on merit and need and place particular emphasis on diversity in the selection process.\r\n\r\nAs an interdisciplinary conference, KDD  brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and governments who work on all aspects of data mining and data science problems. The conference is highly competitive and focuses on training and mentoring students. It includes a technical program with regular peer-reviewed papers in the form of oral and poster presentations, as well as panel discussions and invited talks by leading experts in academia and industry. Besides the technical program, the conference features activities such as workshops, tutorials, panels, posters, project showcases. These will provide a comprehensive multi-facet learning experience to students at all levels. The award will be advertised and the results will be announced at the KDD 2022 website (https://www.kdd.org/kdd2022/) as well as various data mining mailing lists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
