 "awd_abstract_narration": "To prepare learners to productively use scientific knowledge as they navigate life, science courses must develop students\u2019 understandings of what it means to know and learn science (i.e., their epistemologies). This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a researcher\u2019s skills to conduct fundamental chemistry education research that investigates both instructors\u2019 and students\u2019 epistemologies in the context of organic chemistry courses. Studies indicates that instructors can send tacit messages about knowledge and knowing that shape the epistemologies students adopt. Thus, we need to better understand how science instructors can communicate the value of epistemologies useful in school and in life. This project assumes that epistemologies prevalent in science research laboratories (\u201cdoing science\u201d epistemologies) have the potential to be more useful in life than epistemologies that are typical of science courses (\u201cdoing school\u201d, such as memorizing facts and seeking a single correct answer to a problem). Thus, supporting instructors in activating \"doing science\" epistemologies in chemistry course examination contexts would be expected to lead to productive changes in learning environments. This project will map the epistemologies that shape instructors\u2019 testing practices in organic chemistry courses. The project team will also explore ways to encourage instructors to adopt \"doing science\" epistemologies in course assessment scenarios. In the process of this work, the principal investigator will cultivate expertise in inferring tacit epistemological ideas from behavior via coursework and mentoring.\r\n\r\nThis project will integrate research and professional development objectives to support the principal investigator in developing the qualitative methods skills needed to achieve his long-term goals. The project is directed toward modeling the epistemologies that shape how and why organic chemistry instructors prompt for and respond to knowledge products in research and teaching settings. Across three years, the research team will explore the enacted epistemologies of three organic chemistry instructors who represent different roles and epistemologies in a chemistry department. The team will conduct semi-structured interviews focused on how and why instructors prompt for and respond to students\u2019 knowledge products on exams, record research group meetings, and attempt to tip instructors into adopting \"doing science\" epistemologies in the context of teaching tasks in an interview setting. Both thematic and case-study analysis of epistemologies enacted while \"doing science\" and \"doing school\" will be used to support claims about productive epistemological ideas instructors have for attending to student thinking as well as when and how these ideas are activated. Throughout the process of eliciting, interpreting, and drawing implications from qualitative data, the project team will be mentored by an expert on epistemology from the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison. The project team will have frequent meetings with the mentor to discuss targeted readings as well as progress and plans for the project. The PI will also complete coursework on qualitative methods. Project outcomes are expected to include rich descriptions of tacit epistemologies activated while prompting for and responding to knowledge products in different contexts, analytic methods for inferring instructors\u2019 epistemologies from behavior, and development of the project team\u2019s qualitative methods skills. The principal investigator will share findings via workshops, presentations, and research publications. The mentor and three- member advisory board of experts in epistemological learning will assess the success of the project. The project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program, which is designed to build investigators\u2019 capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
