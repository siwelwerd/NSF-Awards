 "awd_abstract_narration": "While one of the promises of the upcoming 5G/6G systems is to offer increased performance in terms of coverage and performance, there is a major effort in integrating millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into Next Generation Networks (NextG). As there will be more and more connected devices per capabilities of NextG systems, the attack surface for cyberthreats arising from both classical and quantum computers will also be expanded. More importantly, as the progress in building quantum computers is becoming more realistic, it is prudent to adapt end-to-end quantum-resistant security protocols into the NextG systems as they get designed and deployed for data in-transit and at-rest. \r\n\r\nThis project will integrate concepts from quantum-safe device level security, wireless networking, security management and network evaluation in ways that have not been studied before. Major project activities include the following: (i) investigation of quantum-safe cryptography algorithms for the IoT devices deployed in NextG systems, (ii) efficient quantum-safe certificate management in NextG systems, and (iii) end-to-end deployment and evaluations of quantum-safe cryptography in NextG systems. Potential outcomes will focus on bringing significant benefits to society as the project will increase the security of everyday connections against the attacks from sponsored attackers with future access to quantum computers benefiting both defense and commercial entities. This project will also offer training opportunities for under-represented students to conduct quantum-cryptographic research on a real-life 5G testbed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
