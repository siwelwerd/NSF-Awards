 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project, the team will research advanced magnesium (Mg)-based electrolytes facilitating the development of novel (non-Lithium-based) low-cost and high-performance rechargeable batteries. In response to rapidly increasing energy storage demands of consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and clean energy storage, there is an urgent call for advanced rechargeable batteries with superior energy storage performance compared to state-of-the-art Li ion batteries. Magnesium is a highly attractive anode material due to its high charge capacity, mild reactivity, domestic availability, and low-cost. However, the lack of high-performance Mg2+ ion conductive electrolytes has been a primary technical hurdle for developing practical Mg batteries. The outcomes of this project will pave the way to develop competent and high energy density Mg batteries for applications in portable devices, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage, thereby alleviating reliance on fossil fuels and their adverse environmental impacts and enhancing the sustainable development of our society. This project integrates outreach activities aimed at promoting research experience and scientific vision of high school and undergraduate students, particularly emphasizing the involvement of underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental research focuses on developing advanced Cl-free magnesium pinacolatoborate electrolytes while establishing a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship of designed Mg electrolytes. The project will result in new in depth understanding of the interfacial and/or intercalation chemistry of the designed Cl-free magnesium pinacolatoborate electrolytes with Mg anode and Mg ion intercalation/insertion cathode materials through an integrated experimental and computational approach. Since current understanding of Mg batteries significantly lags that of Li-ion batteries, this project will yield a substantial knowledge foundation to develop competent high energy density Mg battery technologies for electrochemical energy storage. In addition, the gained fundamental knowledge will also benefit the development of other multivalent battery technologies such as calcium and aluminum batteries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
