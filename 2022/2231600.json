 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participation by junior researchers, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school teachers in the 34th Midwestern Conference on Combinatorics and Combinatorial Computing (MCCCC34), which will be held at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois, on October 21-23, 2022. The MCCCC began as the Carbondale Combinatorics Conferences which were held (1986-1990) at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. The conference has since evolved into a prestigious national conference in all areas of combinatorics and combinatorial computing. It has achieved recognition and attracted scholars and researchers of various backgrounds from national and international institutions. A recent trend in the MCCCC series is the increased participation of graduate and undergraduate student researchers. The conference will feature 6 principal 50-minute speakers and about 60 contributed 20-minute talks by participants from throughout the nation and other parts of the world. We estimate around 100 participants will attend. The selection process for funding support will prioritize women, members of underrepresented groups, people with disabilities, veterans, and students. The Conference is supported in part by Illinois State University and by the Institute for Combinatorics and its Applications.\r\n\r\nAfter a 2-year hiatus due to the pandemic, we aim to nurture and expand the opportunities at the MCCCC34 by making mathematics research more accessible and inclusive, and emphasizing recruitment and support for both graduate and undergraduate students. MCCCC34 will cover a spectrum of pure and applied combinatorics, including graph theory, design theory, enumeration, and combinatorial computing. The conference will provide a conducive atmosphere for research mathematicians, graduate students, undergraduate students, and others interested in combinatorics and combinatorial computing to explore and discuss a variety of research problems in these areas, particularly problems that have a connection to both areas.  The conference organizers aim to publish the conference proceedings in a research journal. The conference website can be found at: https://about.illinoisstate.edu/mcccc34/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
