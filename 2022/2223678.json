 "awd_abstract_narration": "SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID. It can be detected in wastewater. Its detection can act as a signal to a community that the infection is spreading locally. The goal of this project is to develop living sensors that can continuously monitor wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Living microbial sensors are robust and low-cost. They can regenerate themselves and can be engineered to detect a specific biomolecular target of interest. The modular design can be easily repurposed to detect and monitor a variety of chemical and biological targets in the environment. Training undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers will advance the development of a competitive bioeconomy workforce. The project will also establish new K-12 outreach programs in collaboration with Houston-area public schools.  Enhancing current programs that offer research opportunities to community college students and K-12 teachers is another objective. Engaging the public and relevant stakeholders to address ethical, legal, and social implications of living microbial devices is another important aspect of this project.\r\n\r\nDevelopment and deployment of living microbial sensors is the overall objective of this project. These sensors will be based on engineered electroactive microorganisms. Addressing broader societal challenges related to the potential adoption of engineered microbial devices, including safety, legal, and regulatory concerns is another important aspect of the project. Several fundamental science and engineering challenges must be met to make such devices. Establishing methods for engineering microbes that can directly detect large macromolecules, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is one. Developing scalable methods for processing engineered microorganisms into functional biohybrid materials is another. Designing compact and low power devices that can amplify electronic signals delivered by the electroactive microbes is a third. Ultimately, evaluating the stability and performance of these devices in different environmental settings, including wastewater, will be critical to establishing the efficacy of these devices The project team will also identify and conduct in-person semi-structured interviews with vested stakeholders such as regulators, public health experts, infectious disease specialists, and environmental advocates. The interviews will identify major public concerns and regulation that could impede implementing the proposed bioelectronic technology. Altogether, this work will provide a solid foundation and analysis for understanding, developing, and translating living microbial sensors as real-time and low-cost environmental sensors.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (EFMA) and the Department of Defense \u2013 Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
