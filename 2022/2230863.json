SPLASH is a premier forum that brings together researchers working on foundations and applications of programming languages and software engineering. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshops in addition to the several conferences held under the SPLASH umbrella. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and programming systems research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
