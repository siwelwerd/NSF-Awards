 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Environmental change is expected to cause major shifts in plant species ranges. It is important to understand the direction and consequence of those shifts. Plant ranges are predicted to move towards the poles and higher elevations. However, previous research suggests plant populations are following different trajectories, including no change, or shifting in the opposite direction than predicted. Therefore, it appears that factors such as how plants interact with each other must be considered for making predictions about changing plant species ranges. With this research, the fellow aims to increase the understanding of how plant communities will be altered in a changing climate and how plant interactions shape those changes. Mountain ecosystems in temperate regions have been studied. Here the fellow will expand knowledge by investigating tropical mountain ecosystems in the Andes to analyze range changes and test ecological theories. This study will make contributions to the fields of community ecology and global change biology while strengthening international collaborations between US scientists and scientists from Andean countries, with an emphasis on Ecuador. \r\n\r\nOne key factor affecting the shift in plant ranges may be how the presence or absence of a dominant species will affect the subordinate species in their new range. If the dominant species is absent from the novel community, the abundance and diversity of subordinate species may be reduced or enhanced if the dominant species primarily acts as a facilitator or competitor, respectively. To test these concepts, the fellow will transplant naturally occurring turfs in the Ecuadorian Andes to higher elevations, artificially warm some of the turfs using open top chambers and remove the dominant species from some turfs. Functional traits, growth forms, of the plant species will be tested to determine whether these traits aid in predicting the response of the subordinate species to the presence or absence of the dominant species under the new (elevated and/or warmer) conditions. This research will expand the fellow\u2019s research expertise and will provide opportunities for Ecuadorian postdocs, researchers, and students to participate in biological research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While some studies have suggested that plants will move towards higher latitudes and altitudes under warmer conditions, other studies have shown that species could have a spectrum of context-dependent responses. These differences make it difficult to predict the magnitude and direction of change in species ranges. Therefore, to better understand these biodiversity patterns, we need to understand the mechanism behind these responses. To do that, we created a conceptual framework that isolates one important source of context-dependency&ndash;&ndash;species interactions. To test our conceptual framework, we designed and executed a turf-transplant experiment simulating vegetation displacement towards higher elevations and isolating the role of species interactions in species range shifts under altered climatic conditions. Our two main research questions for this project were: 1) how do species interactions mediate biodiversity patterns during range shifts? and 2) how do functional traits mediate those species interactions? In 2023, we established our turf-transplant experiment in a high-elevation ecosystem in the Ecuadorian Andes, locally known as p&aacute;ramo. We extracted 120 turfs from two elevations, 4,100 m asl and 4,300 m asl. We moved turfs from lower to higher elevations and vice versa. We also moved turfs from 4,100 m asl within the same elevation as a control for the turf-extracting method. Next, we installed 40 open-top chambers (20 per elevation), which passively increased the ambient temperature of the plot. Then, we removed the dominant vegetation in 60 plots to test how species interact without the dominant species present. Finally, we installed 120 temperature data loggers in each one of the plots, and we collected baseline biodiversity data from all the plots. One year later, we monitored the plots, collecting biodiversity and functional trait data. We also collected all the data from the data loggers. Furthermore, we photo-documented every plot to track the difference from year to year. We found that in our transplanted plots, the cushion plants, which are important plants in high-elevation ecosystems, decreased in coverage. Because this also occurred in the control turf transplants (turfs moved within the 4,100 m asl elevation), we found that this decrease in coverage was a function of the transplanting methodology. On the other hand, we found that rosettes from the&nbsp;</span><em>Werneria</em><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em>Hypochaeris</em><span>&nbsp;genera increased in coverage. Finally, in areas where the cushion plants decreased in coverage, there was an increase in&nbsp;</span><em>Rumex acetosella</em><span>, an invasive species in this ecosystem. From our first year of monitoring, we found that there are important dynamics at play from a species interaction perspective. Over time, we will be able to see how temperature plays a role in these interactions. This experiment became a part of two international data-sharing networks, the TransPlant Network and the International P&aacute;ramo and Puna Experiment (IPPEX). With this project, we can better understand the impacts of environmental alterations on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ecosystems that provide resources and services for millions of people. Furthermore, we can isolate the species&rsquo; characteristics to help predict impacts on the vegetation community. Finally, this project helped provide mentorship and training for early career scientists interested in field ecology research.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/27/2025<br>\nModified by: Sisimac&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duchicela</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492203133_IMG_5887--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492203133_IMG_5887--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Moving the turf transplants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492203133_IMG_5887--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Moving the turf transplants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The turf transplants were extracted from their origin location and then moved to their destination location.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sisimac Duchicela</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sisimac&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duchicela\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Moving the turf transplants</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492573247_IMG_6235--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492573247_IMG_6235--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Moving the transplants (part 2)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492573247_IMG_6235--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Moving the transplants (part 2)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The turfs were too heavy to carry so we had a donkey help us move the turfs from one elevation to the other.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sisimac Duchicela</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sisimac&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duchicela\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Moving the transplants (part 2)</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492853832_IMG_6373--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492853832_IMG_6373--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Planted turf\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209352/2209352_10807994_1737492853832_IMG_6373--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Planted turf\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">When we planted the turfs some of them had biomass removal and others that did not.
