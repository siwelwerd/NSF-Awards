 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will address how plate tectonics causes fragments of continents to \u201cchip off\u201d and move along the continental margin to a new location, often thousands of kilometers away from where they formed. This process has been termed tectonic escape and has played an essential role in shaping the mountainous terrain in western North America over the last ~100 million years. Professors Waldien and Regan will study this tectonic phenomenon by unraveling the geologic evolution and uplift history of the Ahklun Mountains in western Alaska because this region is the northernmost extent of continental fragments that have moved northward along western North America. The study will test the hypothesis that magmatism and uplift in the Ahklun Mountains is related to temporal fluctuations in the amount of tectonic escape over the last ~70 million years. Due to the remote location and inherent relationship between rural communities and the western Alaska landscape, the project will be used to train first-generation college student geologists from first-people communities in Alaska and South Dakota (locations of host institutions). All personnel working on the project will participate in public outreach presentations at Wood-Tikchick State Park emphasizing the relationship between the bedrock geology and the unique landscape of western Alaska.\r\nEscape tectonics is commonly evoked in collisional systems to aid in orogenic space limitations by translating crustal material away from collisional indenter(s). In accretionary orogens however, strike-slip deformation develops in response to oblique relative plate motion and results in the translation of forearc slivers. If persistent over prolonged time, the accumulated strike-slip displacement may manifest as forearc escape. Accretionary orogens present a challenge to classical models of escape tectonics because the obliquity of relative plate motion and the broad wavelength geometry of strike-slip faults can change over the duration of orogenesis, thus the proportion of plate motion taken up as escape may vary greatly through time. The 3-year project intends to test the long-proposed model of Cordilleran escape tectonics by documenting the Cretaceous-Cenozoic offset and deformation history along the southwestern terminal onshore segment of the Denali fault system in the Ahklun Mountains of western Alaska. Key questions addressed by the study will include: 1) Do reactivated suture zone faults in the Ahklun Mountains and associated extensional magmatism together represent a partitioned obliquely convergent margin that was active during an escape regime? 2) Do structures inherited from the assembly of the Cordillera focus strike-slip and/or shortening during the downscaling of escape? 3) Is the transition out of a primary escape tectonics regime recorded by the uplift/exhumation of the Ahklun mountains? and 4) Does the timing of reduced escape tectonics correspond with suggested Paleocene-Eocene oroclinal bending of southern Alaska? PIs Waldien and Regan will pursue answers to these questions by employing regional geologic mapping, structural analysis, petrography, thermochronology, geochronology, and geochemistry in a series of focus areas within the Ahklun Mountains to 1) determine the timing of and cause of magmatism and rock exhumation in the Ahklun Mountains, 2) identify offset markers that may be used to restore Denali fault strike-slip displacement at different time intervals, and 3) couple the fault restoration and timing of exhumation/magmatism to regional tectonic processes operating at the scale of the orogen. Results from this study will test whether tectonic escape was steadfast or fluctuated along the Cretaceous-Cenozoic Denali fault system and identify the tectonic scenario(s) associated with transitions among primarily indentation, rotation, and escape regimes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
