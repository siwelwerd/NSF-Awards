 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits is the 26th in a series of conferences that serves as one of the premier conferences for international researchers with differing levels of experience to gather and discuss issues concerning the geochemistry of metal transportation and deposition in the natural environment. This year, a focus of the GRC is on game-changing developments in mineral deposits, such as big data, biosystems, new frontiers, and stewardship. In the current climate of needing to discover and sustainably extract more mineral deposits that ever before in human history, and the accelerating demand for rare materials to support the renewable energy transition, the 2022 meeting will be critical to generate innovative approaches to transform the science. The joint meetings of the GRC and GRS will ensure that the next generation of leaders will be able to engage with current leaders in these fields.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 Gordon Conference on the Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits will present a forum to present and discuss new data and ideas. The GRC will open with a discussion of how \u201cbig data'' and machine learning techniques can be applied to the study of, and exploration for, ore deposits. Sessions include detailed appraisals of mineralizing processes that control the formation, and size of a wide range of ore deposits including precious metals, base metals, and other critical elements relevant to supporting a cleaner, more electrified world. There is a session dedicated to the practical realities of using geochemistry in exploration programs. Other sessions will focus on the next generation of models, biological processes and the challenges of mining frontier settings such as the seafloor and in space. The final session will discuss where the future lies and will also showcase one of the young scientists who presented at the GRS, who will have the opportunity to give their talk again to the GRC attendees. There is no doubt that the pandemic has greatly impacted the networking and development of especially early-career scientists. This award will allow early-career scientists to present research and engage with scientists from around the world who are focused on the evolution and sustainability of ore minerals for our growing society. The format of the meeting provides for an abundance of interaction among participants, and is an ideal venue for early-career researchers to advertise who they are and get feedback on where they are going. A Gordon Research Seminar will be organized by, and for, students, and will have a mentorship panel focused on careers with members from government, academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
