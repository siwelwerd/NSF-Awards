 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide support for early career scientists, including graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, to attend the 2022 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Cellular and Molecular Fungal Biology (Holderness School, New Hampshire), just prior to the corresponding Gordon Research Conference. These conferences bring together diverse scientists who study fungal biology at different scales (molecules to populations) and from different disciplinary perspectives (genetics, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, immunology, evolutionary biology, systems and synthetic biology, etc.) The research advances basic knowledge about fungi, including their interactions in complex host and environment systems, and their evolution, which has implications for biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. The GRS serves as a forum for junior US and international scientists to present unpublished research, exchange ideas and resources, benefit from career mentoring, and build their professional network. The GRS is organized and co-chaired by two post-doctoral scholars, which serves as a significant career development experience. \r\n\r\nThe GRS and associated GRC will advance research on fungi, integrating classical cell and molecular biology and modern data-rich approaches. Investigators from around the world will have the opportunity to discuss pioneering ideas in the field and potentially launch new collaborations. The GRS in particular will facilitate training and professional development of a diverse group of scientists in the field of fungal biology.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and Cellular Dynamics and Function programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
