 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for attendees of the International Workshop on MXenes: Addressing Global Challenges with Innovative 2D Nanomaterials to be held at Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1-3 August 2022. The workshop focuses on the latest research and development activities in MXenes and other novel 2D nanomaterials. The students and faculty present through oral and poster sessions their latest research results to the broad materials science, materials chemistry, materials processing and advanced manufacturing communities. Priority is given to students who are women or who come from underrepresented minority groups. This approach promotes diverse participation at the workshop, in the short term, and in STEM fields, in the long term. This award benefits the nation through the education of a skilled and diverse materials and manufacturing workforce, which is better prepared to provide transformative solutions the challenges in their chosen fields. The workshop plays an important role in supporting and sustaining the important field of MXenes and 2D nanomaterials, a technology that is pervasive and impacts across all industrial sectors with benefits to society. This workshop is timely because of strong interest in the U.S in fostering the research and development of this technologically important novel material system that exhibits many useful and unique properties and potential applications.\r\n\r\nThis participant support is expected to benefit the students' professional, scientific and technical development. Attendance at the workshop gives the students and faculty a broader view of materials chemistry, ceramics, advanced manufacturing, their fundamentals and applications. Workshop topics include fundamentals of MXenes and 2D nanomaterials, synthesis and scalable nanomanufacturing, process development, microstructural analysis, and process modeling, monitoring and control.  Attendees will learn about state-of-the-art research in their technical areas via access to several technical and professional development talks by leading domestic and international speakers. Students and young faculty enhance their communication skills through oral and poster presentations and in-depth discussions of their work with peers in their technical areas. This interactive experience significantly broadens student education, increases their enthusiasm for their research topic, acquaints them with expectations for scientific careers, and exposes them to new approaches for innovative research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
