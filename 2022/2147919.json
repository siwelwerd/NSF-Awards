 "awd_abstract_narration": "Racial and ethnic segregation in U.S. cities has been linked to a wide range of contemporary social problems, including inequalities in employment, education, and health. This study investigates the origins of the very high levels of residential segregation in metropolitan areas that were reached by the mid- to late-20th Century. The project examines which neighborhoods were targeted for restrictive covenants, deeds that restrict a property owner from renting or selling to identified racial and ethnic groups. The study considers the impact of both restrictive covenants and mortgage redlining \u2013 the designation of racial and ethnic minority neighborhoods as high-risk for lending \u2013 on neighborhood and socioeconomic change. In addition to the experience of African Americans, this study investigates the segregation of Hispanic Americans, who were a major presence in many urban areas as early as the 1930s. The research generates new data infrastructure that will be useful to other social scientists, including high resolution GIS maps and census data across 45 major cities for every decade from 1920 through 1970.\r\n\r\nTo better understand the origins and impacts of residential segregation, this project intensively studies 45 major metropolitan areas in the period 1920-1970. Data sources include newly available redlining maps prepared by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the late 1930s, mapped data on the location of restrictive covenants in several cities, and Census data at the enumeration district scale. Data visualization is paired with models of neighborhood change that estimate the effects of redlining and restrictive covenants over time. Better understanding the processes that created residential segregation is useful to decision-makers who are taking steps to undermine residential segregation and its social and economic harms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis is a study of public and private practices that contributed to the ghettoization of racial and ethnic minorities in the mid-20thCentury. The study charted the trajectory of urban racial segregation decade by decade for the whole period 1900-2020 for the first time. In addition, it broke down the total segregation in metropolitan areas to its spatial components: segregation among central city neighborhoods, segregation among suburban neighborhoods, segregation across suburban communities, and segregation between the city and the suburbs. There are two important findings. One concerns the early years of the century, 1900-1940, when past research reported that an initial low level of segregation grew increasingly to near apartheid levels. By measuring segregation at finer spatial scales than city wards, it was possible to show that segregation was very high even in 1900 at the scale of local streets. Besides increasing segregation, results show that segregation expanded its spatial scale from a relatively fragmented micro scale in 1900 to encompass whole districts of cities by 1940. The second finding also is related to the scale of segregation. While segregation within cities was the predominant factor in the early part of the century, it then tended to decline after the 1940s. Instead, by 2020 the largest component of segregation is between suburban communities, which reflects the exclusionary policies of local suburban governments in the whole postwar era.\n\n\nThe project also examined racial changes at the scale of individual neighborhoods. This part of the study focused on redlining policies that limited investments in housing in minority neighborhoods in the period 1920-1970. A major question was the distinction between redlining practices by private mortgage providers and by the federal government. To deal with these questions required an intensive effort to map major U.S. cities in 1930 and 1940, and to use population census data to describe neighborhoods in 1930, 1940, and 1970 within consistent neighborhood boundaries. To test the independent impact of both kinds of policies on trajectories of neighborhood change, we developed models to predict what neighborhoods were redlined in the late 1930s, and then to predict how private and public redlining affected outcomes in the 1950-1970 period. An important conclusion based on work in progress is that redlining by the federal government (as documented in the mortgage risk maps of the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) closely mirrored the existing policies of private lenders. Both were mainly influenced by market characteristics of neighborhoods, such as their class composition and levels of home ownership. Racial composition played a small part in private redlining, and a larger (but still small) role in the HOLC mapping. Analysis is still in progress to determine how redlining affected neighborhood change, which requires mapping neighborhoods at a fine scale in 1950 and 1970 and estimating the population and housing characteristics of those neighborhoods.\n\n\nThe historical neighborhood data developed for this purpose will also be applied to a related question: how the prevalence of restrictive covenants also may have promoted segregation. These covenants were written into property deeds, and especially in the suburbs they were enforced by large-scale property developers as a means to exclude minorities (especially Blacks, and often Hispanics, Jews, or other marginalized groups). \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnRLogan\n"
