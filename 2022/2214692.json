 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the European Set Theory Conference held in Turin, Italy on August 29 - September 2, 2022. This is the eighth in a biennial series of conferences that are organized by the European Set Theory Society. In addition to Americans and Europeans, the conference will be attended by researchers from around the world, including Japan, China, the Middle East,  and Latin and South America. It is a remarkable opportunity for students and junior researchers to meet and interact with established international experts.  The conference is also the venue for awarding the Hausdorff Prize, the premier honor for work in Set Theory. The grant supports travel for US-based junior researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) and a small number of the US-based invited plenary speakers. \r\n\r\nWhile set theory arose in connection with the foundations of mathematics, in the last two decades it has begun focusing on applications to neighboring areas of mathematics. These range from combinatorial methods applied to C*-algebras, to Ramsey theory, to topological dynamical systems. Two prominent senior set theorists, Saharon Shelah and Stevo Todor\u010devi\u0107, are plenary speakers, and the US-based plenary speakers include two invited speakers from the 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://logicgroup.altervista.org/torino/ESTC2022/index2.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
