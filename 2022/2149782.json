 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth is surrounded by electrons and ions that create beautiful auroral displays but are also a hazard for orbiting satellites. These particles collect on satellite surfaces causing the satellite to charge to high levels. A sudden discharge can cause a damaging surge in electronic components and cause the satellite to behave in unexpected ways or completely stop responding. The SCOPULI project will investigate the physical mechanisms that produce this hazardous charged particle environment, educate society about the causes and effects of these charging events, and build tools to help government and industry prevent damaging impacts to our satellite infrastructure. SCOPULI is a collaborative project between the University of California Los Angeles, the University of Colorado Boulder, Space Hazards Applications, and Space Weather Solutions. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop physics- and machine-learning based models that span the solar wind and magnetosphere, and provide estimates of energetic (eV to keV) electron flux to predict spacecraft surface charging hazards. Models of electron population and of electric and magnetic fields, in combination with injection events with existing data products via data assimilation and machine learning, will be leveraged to develop a charging environment prediction capability. The models will allow users to provide their own satellite specifics, thus allowing for new or non-standard designs to be tested and provided charging predictions. The team will develop curriculum materials and interactive simulations with science teachers (grades 6-12), as well as industry-ready tools for real-time specification of space weather. A postdoc and graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the project. ANSWERS projects advance the nation\u2019s STEM expertise and societal resilience to space weather hazards by filling key knowledge gaps regarding the coupled Sun-Earth system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
