 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, 12-15 October 2022. The BMES Annual Meeting serves as the premier event for scientific sharing and dissemination amongst biomedical engineers in the academic, industry and educational sectors. Beyond research and educational presentations, the mission of the 2022 BMES annual meeting is to provide opportunities for building strategic networks, promoting career development and advancement, sharing ideas, recognizing and promoting talent, developing and promoting professional excellence, and broadening the participation of underserved and underrepresented groups. This award will provide critical support to enhance diversity of participants at the BMES Annual Meeting and advance inclusion and promote success in continuing in the Biomedical engineering (BME) educational pathway and profession.  \r\n\r\nThe 2022 BMES meeting will focus on the future to showcase innovative developments in research and education. The theme of this meeting is equity issues in healthcare and education stemming from racial and socioeconomic diversity, gender and sexual orientation, and disabilities. The meeting will connect research and education communities to stimulate new strategies to advance healthcare. The meeting will be highlighted by exciting plenary speakers, research sessions, workshops, and outreach programs that will provide valuable information and opportunities to engage with the biomedical engineering community. There will be activities at the 2022 Annual Meeting to increase participation from underrepresented minority engineering groups across multiple stages, including high school students, community college students, undergraduate, and graduate students, postdoctoral trainees and early career faculty and professionals. This award will support two merit-based awards (Student Chapter Awards), a High School Expo, and online streaming fee waivers for underserved individuals. These activities will help ensure value to a broader representation of BME Annual Meeting attendees and encourage diverse perspectives and innovative thinking in planning and evaluation of meeting activities. This broader representation at the BMES Annual Meeting will help expand participation of underrepresented groups in both BME and in engineering, and will contribute to engaging the future generation of biomedical engineers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
