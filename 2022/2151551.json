 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to help manage environmental change in coastal cities. Currently, a gap exists in the coastal infrastructure community for an effective solution that supports ecological health and community-based co-benefits over traditional gray infrastructure, such as seawalls, berms, or structured fill. This project addresses that gap through a novel full-scale experimental implementation of a reliable and durable network of floating biomass-based modules for coastal protection. The proposed project develops a dynamic, detail-oriented scientific approach and technical modeling. This project will demonstrate how an interconnected, anchored network of vegetated biomass modules can dampen wave energy, absorb water pollutants, and create an engaging community space for coastal cities.\r\n\r\nThe technical innovations of the proposed SBIR Phase II project are: (A) a new material engineering approach for seaworthy floating modules based on biomass and living plants, anchored in a hexagonal array and interconnected; (B) a full numerical predictive modeling suite to simulate biogeochemical effects, fluid dynamic network effects, and hydrodynamic effects of large such networks of modules; and (C) a fully functional prototype network to study physical behavior and effects. This project consists of five separate experimental objectives: (1) extensive unit prototyping, redesign and monitoring to assess manufacturer material and biological behavior over time, (2) ecological monitoring of individual unit and network impacts leading to the development of a predictive biogeochemical model, (3) translation of physical wave tank lab results into a predictive coastal environment simulation model, (4) hydrodynamic analysis of a full-scale experimental network prototype, and (5) development of technical methods for production and deployment at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Emerald Tutu NSF SBIR project focused on developing techniques for Nature-Based Infrastructure (NBI) on urban coastlines as shoreline protection, and quantifying their performance. Adding vegetation and mass to shorelines and nearshore areas reduces storm impacts and improves habitat, water quality, and public space for humans. The simple, scalable, modular techniques we developed to create NBI are widely applicable to any coastal area where salt marsh grass grows natively. We designed, trialed, and iterated floating prototype units of varying forms and sizes and deployed them in locations around East Boston and several other New England areas. Although differing in design, all prototype units were composed mostly of biomass (85%+), included non-biodegradable foam for long-term buoyancy, and made use of a Y-shaped three-point internal rope with friction barbs as a tethering system to attach each unit to neighboring units and/or anchoring systems. This enables the individual modules to maintain their integrity while linking to many other units and forming a vast network.\r\n\n\nThe scientific performance evaluation of our work included laboratory research in the wave research tanks at Oregon State University, and numerical modeling using supercomputers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Northeastern University. Combining laboratory measurements and computational results allowed for quantitative validation of the effectiveness of our modular network design for wave reduction at larger scales. To quantify the ecological performance of our NBI system, we conducted greenhouse research, observing controlled salt marsh grass root growth in soil mats made of dead plant biomass mixes, as well as measuring the marsh grass uptake of a nitrogen isotope tracker to quantity the nutrients that our floating prototypes would be able to remove from the water (nitrogen removal and carbon sequestration).\r\n\n\nCentral to all of our work is our commitment to built many community connections in our neighborhood of East Boston and beyond, with a Do-It-Yourself / Do-It-Together framework to further the impact of our project. We lead skills training workshops and open houses for NBI installation and maintenance that are aimed to spread NBI hands-on knowledge. We believe that spreading these skills will help coastal communities benefit economically from their NBI investments by creating NBI-focused green jobs.\r\n\n\nWe presented our work at community events, scientific conferences, and coastal resilience policy groups. We published results in scientific journals, and our project was covered repeatedly by popular media, both nationally and locally in Massachusetts. We believe that developing successful coastal NBI by persistent hands-on work in the field is the only way that vulnerable coastlines will be protected and restored to healthy marshy ecosystems at any significant scale.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/20/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GabrielCira\n"
