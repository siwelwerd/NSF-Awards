 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThere is a growing interest in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to a wide array of tasks, including, but not limited to, health, online moderation, and education. NLP-related research has generally focused on large models uniformly applied to everyone independent of their writing style and social norms, thus, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. Nevertheless, NLP-based models do not perform equally for all communities because of different writing styles (e.g., dialects) and choices of topical discussion (e.g., Sports vs. Technology). Furthermore, social norms vary between communities, making the original intended use of some NLP models potentially irrelevant. Hence, applying the same NLP model to everyone may cause harm if communities are not directly considered. Therefore, researchers and practitioners must evaluate NLP models on community data before they deploy them. They must also work with communities to determine whether the technology is sound given the community's social norms and needs. This project will address two critical questions: \"How can stakeholders know whether the model will harm specific communities when put into production?\" and \"What community-specific language patterns cause errors in various NLP models?\". By answering these questions, this project intends to develop tools to help communities participate in the technology development process, which will enable them to decide whether a specific technology is relevant to the community or not. Finally, this project will also create standards-based lessons for high school students in San Antonio by training local high-school teachers in community-driven NLP, which will potentially help local students better consider NLP applications in their lives.\r\n\r\nOverall, this project will provide researchers and NLP practitioners with a better understanding of applying and developing NLP models for small communities rather than focusing on a one-size-fits-all framework. Specifically, to address this goal, this project has three objectives. Objective 1 will identify strategies to find correlations between community-specific language and NLP model performance. This objective will result in a better understanding of the inductive biases of NLP models for community-specific applications. Objective 2 will create a tool that can facilitate participatory NLP design by helping community-specific stakeholders identify potential good and harmful outcomes that may be caused by applying a specific NLP model. More importantly, the objective will help decision-makers decide when NLP should or should not be deployed in their communities. Objective 3 will identify methods to improve NLP models for specific communities. The goal is to identify methods to incorporate a community's unlabeled data into existing labeled NLP datasets to improve community-specific model performance. Finally, the project will impact the broader NLP community via the release of open-source software that implements the tools and techniques this award generates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
