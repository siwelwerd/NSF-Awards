 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThis is a regional project led by University of Maine to build 400 Gbps network connections to large research computing centers in New England, the University of Massachusetts' Green HPC Center and the Northern Crossroads Giga Point of Presence (PoP). It also offers intermediate add/drop support in three other locations (including Keene State College and University of Southern Maine), which would allow for future partners to connect using the existing network. This project funds networking equipment to create a geographically diverse 400 Gbps network connection from the University of Maine to the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center and the Northern Crossroads GigaPoP with intermediate add/drop support in Keene, New Hampshire and Portland, Maine to interconnect other northern New England research partners in the future. These connections use the existing Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) network to deliver more than 10 times the prior capacity. \r\n\r\nThis project has potential to improve the ability to collaborate, share data, and share resources between Maine and the rest of the world. The main beneficiaries will be researchers at small, under-resourced institutions, typically with limited access to world-class cyberinfrastructure. Additionally, because the networking updates from this grant also has potential  to increase the ability of others to reach Maine, the infrastructure will help world-class researchers to reach Maine K-12 students. This access to diverse leaders and innovative technology and research serves to increase aspirations for Maine students. This effect is particularly significant for rural and less affluent school districts. The project's Maine researchers will leverage several highly valuable collaborations, including the Northeast Cyberteam, the Eastern Regional Network, the Northeast Research and Education Network, the Open Storage Network and the Open Science Grid, as well as many personal contacts from these relationships. Maine borders only one other state (New Hampshire) and no state or regional network has a strong reason to build networking resources to reach or pass-through Maine.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded through the collaborative efforts of the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project, led by the University of Maine System, was instrumental in building high capacity network connectivity between Northern New England institutions and the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC). The MGHPCC is the largest academic and research computational site in New England and houses computational equipment from MIT, Harvard, and many other universities. The inability for researchers north of Massachusetts (i.e., Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont) to reach these facilities with low latency and high bandwidth was a detriment to research productivity and collaboration.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n\nAccess to data and computational resources is critical to literally all fields of research. By enabling researchers across Northern New England access to data and resources at MGHPCC at a speed that matches or exceeds access to local resources, barriers to productivity and collaboration are lowered and better science can be done faster and in more areas than was previously possible. This project represents a significant leap forward in research connectivity in the northeast. Because networking is inherently a multi-institutional endeavor, it has also served to strengthen collaborations and encourage human communication. This project has increased connectivity between northern New England Universities and MGHPCC by an order of magnitude or more. Furthermore by adding redundancy the network is more resilient.
