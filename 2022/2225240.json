 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Quantitative Ethnography Institute is to increase the capacity of STEM education researchers to conduct quantitative ethnography (QE) to address fundamental questions in STEM education. A key challenge in STEM education research is using large amounts of rich qualitative data to develop models of student learning that accurately represent diverse learning processes and can be implemented at scale. QE helps mitigate this challenge by unifying quantitative and qualitative techniques, enabling researchers to produce models of large-scale qualitative data that are (1) fair and actionable for diverse learners, educators, and policy leaders and (2) statistically valid and generalizable. \r\n\r\nThe Quantitative Ethnography Institute will recruit three cohorts of 30 participants, the majority of whom will be underrepresented early-career researchers, to engage in a 4-part series of training and mentoring activities identified as the Accelerator, the Incubator, the Booster, and the Multiplier. The Accelerator is the initial 4-day in-person workshop focused on the fundamentals of QE theory, methods, and techniques. The Incubator, which occurs approximately 3 months after the Accelerator, is a 1-day online workshop which gives participants the opportunity to present their QE research-in progress and receive feedback from peers and mentors. The Booster, which occurs approximately 3 months after the Incubator, is a 2-day online focused on techniques for writing successful QE conference papers, journal articles, and grant proposals. The Multiplier, which occurs approximately 3 months after the Booster, is a 2-day online workshop which teaches participants how to run their own QE and workshops.\r\n\r\nThe project is supported by NSF\u2019s EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program, which is designed to build investigators\u2019 capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
