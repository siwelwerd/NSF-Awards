 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve oral health.  Although the conventional antimicrobial compounds in oral cleaning products can kill certain types of bacteria, others are harder to remove. The proposed technology advances a new oral cleaning device that uses magnetic nanoparticles to address this challenge. This project advances the research needed to make this solution effective. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a biofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticle ferropaste that can efficiently remove the oral bacterial biofilms under the control of an external magnetic field. The nanoparticles can significantly enhance antimicrobial activity. The core of the nanocomposites in this product have demonstrated strong magnetism and antibacterial characters in vitro. Under the external magnetic field provided by the magnetic toothbrush, the movement of the nanoparticles can be synchronized. Because of the nanoscale size, the nanoparticles can enter the oral biofilms through the pores on the surface and penetrate the cell wall of the bacteria. Therefore, these particles can disrupt the bacterial cell wall and break the dense biofilms to allow the released bacteria to be sufficiently eliminated by the antimicrobial compounds in the toothpaste. Additionally, the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles will be modified to increase the biocompatibility and favor incorporation into the biofilms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
