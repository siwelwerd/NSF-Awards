The focus of the student research is the study of metals and metal production, an area of vital technological importance to national interest in areas of defense, manufacturing, resource utilization, and energy.  Students will also participate in research projects with the National Park Service focused on the preservation and analysis of historical artifacts as well as supplemental activities like metal forging and casting that highlight the importance of metals throughout history, hence, the Back to the Future theme.   This context will give students a broader appreciation for the nature of current and future research as well as the impact of engineering in society.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe REU Site: Back to the Future at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a 10-week summer program that will provide research opportunities in metallurgical and materials engineering that enhance the global competitiveness of the nation in the areas of mineral beneficiation, resource recovery, strategic metals, advanced materials, manufacturing, and energy-efficient materials.   The project will address challenges faced by future engineers by providing a research experience within a unique cultural and holistic framework.  This framework will be provided by teaming with the National Parks Service on research that has historical significance and innovative activities led by faculty from engineering, science, and the humanities that explore the interface between engineering, history, and art (the Back to the Future theme).  Students will participate in an integrated supplemental training program that nurtures their research skills and career development.  This program includes advanced technical communications training, workshops and seminars to give historical context for current trends in research, and activities that connect students to each other and the community. The diverse nature of program activities will attract students of varied background and intellectual typology.  The Site will provide opportunities for underserved students in engineering with an emphasis on two-year community and Tribal Colleges from the region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
