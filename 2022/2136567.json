 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, self-sustaining, real-time asset tracking technology that addresses the aviation industry\u2019s need for efficiency and safety. This technology will provide automated safety and emergency equipment compliance and security seal checks, significantly reducing the time required for audits, while increasing their accuracy and avoiding potential liability claims from undetected failure or tampering with safety equipment. Based on in-flight compliant Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, equipment can be monitored continuously, during flight and on the ground, using a compact communication hub or mobile devices. Self-sustainability is achieved by harvesting energy from mechanical vibrations present in-flight and during taxiing, without requiring time-consuming battery change cycles and avoiding regulatory challenges for hazardous battery chemistries such as lithium-ion. The proposed research will also enable in-flight monitoring applications and automate new tasks such as ensuring compliance with in-flight seatbelt regulations. The proposed system will help passenger airlines stay profitable in a highly competitive market, realizing significant cost-savings through efficient operations, reduced turnaround times, and lower maintenance overheads. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to evaluate a mechanical energy harvesting design regarding its technical feasibility and effectiveness as a power source for asset tracking devices onboard an aircraft. To this end, new technologies for mechanical energy harvesting will be tested: (1) a novel stacked piezoelectric device with tunable resonance frequencies and output enhanced by superposition among different piezo-elements vibrating in phase and (2) a mechanical vibration amplifier which extracts large-amplitude linear motions from vibrations to enhance the amplitude of mechanical movements. The two new technologies may enable the first mechanical vibration harvester which is compact enough to permit effective use in asset tracking in the aviation industry, resulting in an energy harvesting module miniaturized to comply with aviation applications and to efficiently harvest the extremely low frequencies (<10 Hz) dominating cabin vibrations. The energy harvesting circuit prototype will be evaluated under realistic deployment conditions within the scope of this project and integrated in BLE-sensor prototypes to further evaluate its performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research performed during Phase 1 has addressed this issue and we have developed a prototype properly functioning for Bombardier CRJ 700/CRJ 900/CRJ 1000 series aircrafts and proposed a high-level simple approach for the resonance frequency optimization in such a way that the same device can be adjusted to different commercial aircraft models.\n\nThe small form factor and solid AEROSENS BLE tag structure is ideally suited to life vest stowage units or seat belts and can offer airlines the opportunity to track open/closed status of life vest stowage units and seat belts during the flight.
