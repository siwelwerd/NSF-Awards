 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of microencapsulation materials. Microplastics pollution is an environmental issue that has raised world-wide attention in recent years. Microencapsulated materials in some consumer products that are made from non-biodegradable materials are one possible source of microplastic pollution. The proposed technology microencapsulation technique may be suitable to encapsulate all oil-based materials in the liquid form such as fragrance oils and other ingredients that are used in laundry products, cosmetics, and agrochemical products, etc.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the potential development of a microencapsulation technology that uses food grade natural polymers to potentially replace non-biodegradable microencapsulation materials currently being used in industry that may address part of the microplastics pollution issue. Microencapsulation techniques use a polymer layer to protect the cargo materials from being affected by environmental factors and subsequently release the cargo materials under designated conditions. Current commercially available techniques in consumer products mostly contain petroleum-based materials, which cannot degrade into small molecules in the natural environment after being used and can cause microplastic pollution. The proposed technology is a naturally derived material to potentially encapsulate oil-based materials in consumer products. The proposed technology microencapsulation method has a novel polymer structure that may combine the characteristics of a polyanion structure and an amphiphilic molecular structure that may allow the polymer to be concentrated at the oil-water interface to be crosslinked by the divalent metal ions to form the stable polymer film.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
