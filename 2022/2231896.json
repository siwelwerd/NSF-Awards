 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for the purpose of organizing and holding a workshop titled \"Interdisciplinary Workshop on Weather and Climate Extremes\" which will be held in Clemson, South Carolina on May 16-18, 2023. Recent years have seen an increase in economic losses due to climate and weather extremes, such as wildfires, heat waves, storm surges. Extreme value theory (EVT) provides a framework for studying weather and climate extremes. Compared to more traditional statistical methods, EVT is less well known to many geoscientists and statisticians. It is therefore critical that statisticians with specialized knowledge of EVT interact with geoscientists and applied statisticians working at the interface of statistics, atmospheric and hydrological sciences. This workshop have the following major aims: (i) to facilitate collaborations among statisticians, atmospheric and hydrological scientists; (ii) to present state-of-the-art methods; and (iii) to develop new talent in studying weather and climate extremes. The workshop will include several organized activities, including short courses, panel discussions, invited scientific presentations, a poster session, and team building and brainstorming exercises to establish new research directions and groups. \r\n\r\nThe program of the forthcoming Workshop on Weather and Climate Extremes features the following topics: i) Models for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Extremes; ii) Using Climate Models to Project Future Extremes; iii) Detection and Attribution of Extremes; iv) Coastal Risk and Tropical Cyclones; v) Machine/Deep Learning and Extremes; vi) Linking Large-Scale Conditions and Extreme Events. This project will encourage the participation of graduate students, early-career researchers, and members of groups under-represented in statistics and geosciences. More details about the workshop can be found at: https://whitneyhuang83.github.io/WCE2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our aim was to foster collaboration, advance scientific knowledge, and address the broader impacts of extreme weather events on society. Through 18 presentations and 2 discussion sessions, our workshop deepened understanding of various aspects of weather and climate extremes. We explored the latest research on extreme weather events, including hurricanes, storm surges, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, and their connection to climate change. One major achievement of the workshop was the establishment of new interdisciplinary collaborations. Participants from statistical science, atmospheric science, and coastal engineering shared their expertise, resulting in innovative approaches to studying climate extremes. Through 18 oral presentations given by well-established researchers and 24 poster presentations given by students and postdocs, the workshop showcased cutting-edge tools and methodologies for studying weather and climate extremes. Participants discussed the development of statistical modeling techniques, climate modeling tools, and various new data sources, all of which are critical for studying extreme events. The workshop also emphasized the broader impacts of weather and climate extremes on society. Discussions centered around strategies for enhancing resilience and adaptation, with a focus on vulnerable communities. This underscored the need for science-driven policy and decision-making. In addition to the research talks and discussions, two short courses were offered: one provided a Python tutorial on the Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis, and the other offered a hands-on R software tutorial for extreme value analysis. These courses introduced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to valuable tools for accelerating their research on climate and weather extremes. The Interdisciplinary Workshop on Weather and Climate Extremes has made significant strides in advancing our understanding of extreme weather events and their broader impacts. We are committed to continuing our collaborative efforts to address the challenges posed by climate extremes and to contribute to the resilience and well-being of our communities. We would like to express our gratitude to the National Science Foundation for their support, which made this workshop and its outcomes possible.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Whitney&nbsp;Huang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693624366908_IMG_3917--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693624366908_IMG_3917--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Group Picture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693624366908_IMG_3917--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Group Picture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collaborating Minds: Experts and young researchers from diverse disciplines unite at the Weather and Climate Extremes Workshop.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Murphy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Whitney&nbsp;Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group Picture</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693623197540_IMG-1991--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693623197540_IMG-1991--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693623197540_IMG-1991--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Poster Session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Whitney K Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Whitney&nbsp;Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster Session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693622733763_IMG-1969--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693622733763_IMG-1969--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TECA Short Course\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693622733763_IMG-1969--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TECA Short Course\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Travis O'Brien is delivering the short course on the Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis (TECA).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Whitney K Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Whitney&nbsp;Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">TECA Short Course</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693624015550_IMG-1996--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693624015550_IMG-1996--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Emily Hector\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693624015550_IMG-1996--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Hector\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Emily Hector is presenting her results on analyzing streamflow.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Whitney K Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Whitney&nbsp;Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Emily Hector</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693623043172_IMG_0444--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693623043172_IMG_0444--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EVA Short Course\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2231896/2231896_10821597_1693623043172_IMG_0444--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EVA Short Course\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eric Gilleland is giving a hands-on R software tutorial for extreme value analysis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiyun Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Whitney&nbsp;Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EVA Short Course</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
