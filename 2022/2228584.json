 "awd_abstract_narration": "REFURB will use technology to improve recovery from and preparation for persistent and increasingly severe basement flooding that impacts the Eastside of Detroit, Michigan. Our focus is in neighborhoods that contain older homes connected to aging sewer systems that are undersized, and poorly maintained due to racially driven development policy and investment decisions. Recent research has explored the limitations of managing stormwater through landscape changes, but success is contingent on the type of soil, plants, size, and frequency of storms. In coastal communities, homes need to be \u201csafe to fail\u201d because flooding is currently inevitable. Consistent with NSF\u2019s mission, this work will progress science to improve individual well-being. REFURB will also lead to increased effectiveness of partnerships, which are needed, but do not presently exist. Additionally, data and knowledge built during this work will be used to integrate community perspectives into curricula to enhance a pipeline for social workers, communications professionals, and engineers to work in climate resilience and disaster mitigation. \r\n\r\nThe project's goals are to: (1) Use flood damage reports, environmental and other data to develop provisional, proof-of-concept level risk maps to be used to target adaptations of critical infrastructure to mitigate future flooding vulnerability; (2) Describe the attributes and supports required for effective and equitable disaster recovery and mitigation based on a participatory action case study with at-risk communities working to improve flood prevention, climate resilience, and data access; and (3) Develop understanding of the social structures, systems, and community science literacies necessary for early-warning, response, and flood risk preparedness for residents who lack digital access through a participatory action case study with at-risk communities. REFURB will convene work groups from impacted community residents to co-produce knowledge required to support resilience (i.e., the ability to return to a new normal after disasters) to climate-induced flooding. The first goal will include better techniques to assess the condition of residential sewer pipes and optimize infrastructure investment. A convergent approach combined with robust community engagement will ensure the knowledge about innovative technologies will be scalable and generalizable. Second, building on existing partnerships, this project will develop a community-based framework for improving resilience to climate change. Third, this project will advance techniques used to communicate risk and enhance disaster recovery in communities where not all have smartphones. By learning how people in neighborhoods interact with technology needed to make homes \u201csafe to fail\u201d, findings will inform other urban communities experiencing climate-induced flooding.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2014Track A. Living in a changing climate: pre-disaster action around adaptation, resilience, and mitigation\u2014and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our vision is to ensure that communities who have faced racial and economic discrimination have the information and resources needed to prepare for and respond to climate change induced flooding.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>REFURB worked to build community capacity to recover from future basement flooding. Residents on the Eastside of Detroit, MI experienced dramatic flooding in 2021 due primarily sewers backing up into basements. However, most of the knowledge about flooding is in the context of ocean storms, or rivers overflowing into yards. In order to recover, residents needed to know if their sewer pipes were working. We co-produced solutions with the 27 member East Side Resident Task Force &amp; pilot tested technology (e.g., mitigation map &amp; non-invasive detection of damaged sewer pipes by comparing ground penetrating radar with video scoping in 5 homes. This grounded REFURB in community needs &amp; resident-led solutions to improve health &amp; well-being, access to data, information, technology, communication, &amp; infrastructure.&nbsp; The genesis of our project emerged from insightful discussions among principal investigators, recognizing the intersections of Social Work and Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) within infrastructure and utility services. This approach not only addressed a crucial component of wastewater systems but also fostered interdisciplinary collaboration, bridging the gap between engineering and social work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our research addressed key questions, the first to see if ground-penetrating radar (GPR) would be an effective way to detect broken sewer pipes in back yards. Contrary to our hypothesis, GPR proved impractical due to labor-intensive post-processing, electric interference, and scanning obstructions. Video scoping remains a more practical approach to assess aging sewer laterals directly for backflow preventer installation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;For our second question, we explored community resilience enhancement strategies. Convening the Eastside Flood Task Force revealed priorities such as timely flooding alerts, streamlined resource applications, and green infrastructure development. Qualitative analysis highlighted structural racism as a barrier to equitable flood response, emphasizing the important role of critical thinking and community education in planning for change and advocating for resources.</p>\n<p>Our third question focused on assessing communication technologies for vulnerable residents. Our hypothesis proposed low-tech solutions like text messaging and flag markers. However, residents expressed interest in electronic timely basement flooding alerts, such as home water leak detectors and a variety of communication modes.</p>\n<p>These outcomes contribute to the knowledge base of social work and engineering, enhancing community resilience, and refining disaster communication strategies, providing valuable insights for future interdisciplinary research and community-based initiatives. Our research also informs communication science on emergent organizations and intersects with public health studies on the health impacts of flooding.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Public Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of our work is underscored by its contribution to educational experiences. Through guided research experiences in the eastside of Detroit, CEE students gained hands-on knowledge of urban wastewater systems, operating ground-penetrating radar systems to assess infrastructure conditions. Simultaneously, Social Work students engaged in research, connecting infrastructure malfunctions to societal factors such as income disparities. Underrepresented Students in a Community Social Work course worked with those in an Environmental Engineering Design course, actively participating in the project. This hands-on, interdisciplinary learning approach contributes to the broader development of human resources, enabling emerging engineers to understand the social and cultural contexts of their work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our ongoing educational efforts, including training modules and site visits, have empowered community members with knowledge about their infrastructure. Participation in the Civic Innovation Challenge helped increase organizational capacity of the civic partners and academic partners. The United Way for Southeast Michigan worked with Eastside Community Network and Wayne State University to develop training modules for disaster response case management for social work interns. The project serves as a case study in building community capacity through critical education and social capital building in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Beyond workforce training, our project significantly impacted the community and broader society. Through community engagement and collaborative efforts with the Eastside Flooding Task Force, we launched the drafting of a watershed management plan, while residents worked to secure funding for critical infrastructure changes in Detroit. This along with community residents' training in flooding science and advocacy, demonstrates a positive impact on local decision-making and infrastructure funding. The Eastside Flooding Task Force, formed as a result of our project, has gained national recognition for advocacy, participating in FEMA listening sessions on flood risk mapping.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In conclusion, our project goes beyond intellectual contributions by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, enhancing educational experiences, and creating tangible positive impacts on the community and society at large. Through innovative approaches and community engagement, we have laid the groundwork for a more resilient and informed future in the face of environmental challenges due to climate change.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/21/2023<br>\nModified by: Richard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Smith</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703190849517_erin_stanley_544_x_582_63921ce4d053e--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703190849517_erin_stanley_544_x_582_63921ce4d053e--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Neighborhood residents in masks writing and drawing at a long table.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703190849517_erin_stanley_544_x_582_63921ce4d053e--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Neighborhood residents in masks writing and drawing at a long table.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Front and from left: Arlene Garner (East Side resident leader and member of the Eastside Climate Action Coalition),  Shaton Dockery (East Side resident leader and member of the Eastside Climate Action Coalition), and Erin Stanley (Eastside Community Network Climate Equity Manager and WSU School of S</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eastside Community Network</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Richard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Smith\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Neighborhood residents in masks writing and drawing at a long table.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703191001157_ssw_students_6390e81f47dd1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703191001157_ssw_students_6390e81f47dd1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Three women on an vacant dirt lot in front of an orange bucket listening to a man in a white shirt.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703191001157_ssw_students_6390e81f47dd1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Three women on an vacant dirt lot in front of an orange bucket listening to a man in a white shirt.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">From left: Casey Lee (MSW Student), Jennifer Muscat (MSW Student), Arreana Jackson (MSW Student) and William Shuster (Professor and Chair, Environmental and Civil Engineering) visit the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood to see first hand community response to flooding.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Richard Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Richard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Smith\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Three women on an vacant dirt lot in front of an orange bucket listening to a man in a white shirt.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703193855006_oct252022_fieldwork_11_6390e7d3e5afc--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703193855006_oct252022_fieldwork_11_6390e7d3e5afc--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Two men on grass operating equipment that is orange and on wheels.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2228584/2228584_10825914_1703193855006_oct252022_fieldwork_11_6390e7d3e5afc--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Two men on grass operating equipment that is orange and on wheels.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">From left: Assistant Professor of  Geology Scott Burdick shows Professor Richard Smith how to use Ground Penetrating Radar.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Shuster</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Richard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Smith\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Two men on grass operating equipment that is orange and on wheels.</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
