 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Training Group (RTG) in Computation- and Data-Enabled Science (CADES) at Portland State University is designed to train students and postdocs in computational mathematics and statistics, as well as enable them to develop a broad understanding of current issues in data-driven science. Targeted research directions of societal impact include simulation of optical fibers that drive today's internet, forecasting of weather, air quality, and drought, understanding progression of diseases such as cancer and dementia, and optimizing warehouse locations and wireless services. The research, at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computing, is characterized by intellectual diversity of techniques. Integration across these disciplines is expected to result in enhanced research productivity and uniquely qualified trainees. For this RTG, eight faculty experts integrate research and training with service for the city and the local community. \r\n\r\nThe research group effort integrates numerical techniques for partial differential operators, data-intensive statistical learning, and optimization methods for data science. Specific projects include simulation of light propagation in microstructured optical devices using advanced eigensolvers, improvements to time-evolving simulations by spacetime approaches with and without causality, learning dynamical systems from noisy data, kernel methods for randomized control trials, advanced data assimilation for prediction of complex systems, and optimization methods for multifacility location and machine learning. Mechanisms to accelerate the entry of trainees into these research topics are integrated into the program. The project will establish a Consulting Lab for client-based research and training experiences using real-world data, a byproduct of which is the creation of new consulting services for regional clients. Training innovations include a new seminar favoring dialogue over monologue, buy-in from leaders in the field as external examiners, summer boot camps to overcome anticipated lack of trainee prerequisites for transdisciplinary crossovers, identification of selected external partnering institutions for topical internships, and city-based and community-serving research experiences for undergraduates. All projects require high performance computing and open-source scientific software products. Training in these topics are valued byproducts. The RTG recruitment activities are targeted to increase participation of underrepresented groups. Engagement from external partners in need of US citizen employees augments job prospects for the trainees and helps address shortages in the technical workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
