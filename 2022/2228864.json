 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to plan and organize the 2022 National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart & Connected Communities Principal Investigator (PI) Meeting. This meeting will convene all PIs of active awards the NSF S&CC Program for the fifth time since the program began. The PI Meeting is to take place during the Fall of 2022 in Crystal City, Virginia. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored S&CC researchers, local government and community organization representatives, and Federal agency representatives to gather and review S&CC progress and developments, identify new and emerging research areas, and to discuss research and application gaps and barriers. The program agenda is community-driven and includes presentations (oral and poster) from PIs, reports of past year program activities, and showcasing of new S&CC advancements and innovations. This will be a hybrid PI meeting. It will include both in-person and virtual elements. The virtual component of the PI meeting will also enable a larger community of researchers across academia, government, and industry to participate.\r\n\r\nThe annual PI Meeting serves as the only opportunity where the NSF-funded S&CC PIs meet to share their research, discuss new research opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. Furthermore, the PI meeting is also an opportunity for the academic research community to interact with government agencies with vested interest in S&CC research and development. The PI Meeting is a forum for sharing ideas across the S&CC community. It has played a major role in growing the community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others who have interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or sponsors. The 2022 PI meeting will feature presentations from researchers, poster sessions, special topic workshops, and demonstrations and keynotes from leaders in the research community and local government.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
