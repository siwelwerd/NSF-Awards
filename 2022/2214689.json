 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language change is a fact of life, and among the various types of sound change, vowel merger has featured particularly prominently in linguistic research. Most research on vowel merger has focused on well-studied Indo-European languages such as English, addressing questions related to the production and/or perception of once-distinct vowels that are becoming less distinct (for example, many speakers of US English no longer produce a distinction between the 'cot' and 'caught' vowels, but some of these speakers can nevertheless perceive the distinction). However, investigating the dynamics of vowel merger in less-studied, and non-Indo-European, languages is important to understanding vowel merger because they often contain vowel features that are absent from well-studied languages and, thus, provide new insights into how vowels can change over time. Using a mixed-methods approach, this project examines a case of vowel merger observed in an under-studied language, which contains a vowel feature absent from Indo-European languages. The findings of the project contribute to scientific knowledge of language variation, contact, and change in a multilingual, understudied society, of the relationship between patterns of language variation and the social and attitudinal associations of speech, and of the basis for identifying vowel mergers in languages with unique vowel features. By collecting speech production and perception data across a range of speaker ages and localities, the project also has implications for speech-language pathology, language pedagogy, speech recognition technologies, and forensic linguistics.\r\n\r\nThis project explores patterns of variation that have been implicated in previous cases of vowel merger but focusing on a rarer case of vowel merger. In particular, the project examines whether demographic and social factors, such as age, gender, and locality, help predict the extent of merger in this case; whether a vowel merger in production corresponds to one in perception; and whether a vowel merger that is apparent according to the traditional vowel height and vowel backness dimensions also appears consistently in other, less frequently examined acoustic measures. The project addresses these questions by collecting production and perception data from two different communities (urban versus rural), including adolescents (ages 10-18 years), younger adults (19-39 years), and older adults (40+ years). Production data come from conversational interviews and a picture-naming task; perception data come from a listening task. Audio recordings from the production tasks undergo acoustic analyses, which help determine whether there is a vowel merger in production and support exploration of additional diagnostics for vowel merger. Study participants also complete a detailed questionnaire that includes questions about language/dialect contact and language attitudes. The project results form the basis of the first open-access corpus of the language being studied, a tool for language researchers and a source of information about various speech norms in an under-studied language.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project explored the role of individual and social factors, such as a speaker's age, gender, and place of residence, in the extent of the merger, as well as whether a vowel merger in a speaker's production is consistently reflected in their perception of these vowels. Production and perception data were collected from a diverse group of more than 100 Twi speakers representing two different communities in Ghana (a traditional Twi-speaking community and an urban/non-traditional community), multiple generations ranging from age 12 to 75, and both men and women. Production data came from conversational interviews and a picture-naming task, and perception data came from a listening task. In addition, demographic and social data were collected via a detailed questionnaire.</p>\r\n<p>The findings of the project made contributions to research on language variation and change and to research on Ghanaian languages. Providing evidence of an ongoing sound change within Asante Twi, the project added data from a multilingual, non-Western community to the sociolinguistic literature, challenging some longstanding generalizations on language change from Western societies and demonstrating the importance of speakers' local social context. In addition, no significant relationship was found between production and perception overall, consistent with a hypothesized evolving connection between perception and production that can lead to alignment or misalignment at any given point in time.</p>\r\n<p>By carrying out a series of sociolinguistic and experimental studies of Asante Twi speakers targeting both speech production and speech perception, this project collected a wealth of data that will form the basis of an open-access, annotated corpus of Asante Twi. The current findings provide a detailed source of information about various speech norms in an under-studied language, while the future corpus will provide a useful tool for language researchers and facilitate further research and resource development on Asante Twi.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Charles&nbsp;B&nbsp;Chang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2214689/2214689_10814563_1733854759034_Kpogo2024_fig4_7--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2214689/2214689_10814563_1733854759034_Kpogo2024_fig4_7--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4.7 from Kpogo's (2024) dissertation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2214689/2214689_10814563_1733854759034_Kpogo2024_fig4_7--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4.7 from Kpogo's (2024) dissertation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scatterplot of individual Pillai scores and perceptual accuracies with best-fit regression lines by locality.
