 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific discovery today is driven by computation and data-intensive research that exploits the growing amounts of available data. However, the wide variety and size of emerging datasets often make analysis challenging on current high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures because system configurations cannot be customized to process the data efficiently. This project will acquire and deploy a dynamically composable computer infrastructure called the Kentucky Research Informatics Composable Cloud (KyRICC). This KyRICC architecture will support complex data analysis pipelines with highly heterogeneous hardware requirements not currently supported by current HPC infrastructures. As a result, this project will enable and support a wide range of new research activities. KyRICC will be used by hundreds of University of Kentucky (UK) researchers (faculty, staff, and students) and by other computational research collaborators at institutions across the region including Centre College, Morehead State University, Eastern Kentucky University, University of Louisville, Northern Kentucky University, and Kentucky State University. As a leading-edge system, KyRICC and the exciting projects it makes possible will help recruit students, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM, to computational research. The system will also enhance the research training of many undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in Kentucky colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nThe KyRICC architecture will support complex data analysis pipelines with highly heterogeneous hardware requirements across individual data analysis steps. Specifically, KyRICC will integrate four subsystems that will enable dynamically composable cloud infrastructure: (1) A cluster of peripheral-composable compute nodes, allowing for up to 10\u2019s of GPUs and 10\u2019s of TB of main memory on a single node. Groups of nodes can be dynamically allocated to allow the training and inference of very large deep learning models and datasets; (2) A next-generation high-speed NVMe-based storage cluster capable of efficiently serving large volumes of data to multi-GPU nodes. Unlike traditional clustered storage systems, this composable filesystem allows the partitioning of storage on the project-level, allowing us to isolate data and better manage system performance; (3) A Peta-scale storage system provided by UK\u2019s current research storage infrastructure, providing a total of 2.2 PB of storage; and (4) An innovative workload management system for dynamic infrastructure composition, workload profiling, model and infrastructure tuning, supporting common pipelines and machine and deep learning models through templated projects. KyRICC will be a regional computational resource and will also be made available to the broader national computational research infrastructure through the NSF-supported ACCESS projects. Areas of expected breakthroughs in KyRICC-enabled research include deep learning and computer vision; natural language processing and multimodal embedding; computational modeling and simulation with data analytics; and omics analysis and systemic integration.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, the wide variety and size of emerging datasets often make analysis challenging on current high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures because system configurations cannot be customized to process the data efficiently. This project will acquire and deploy a dynamically composable computer infrastructure called the Kentucky Research Informatics Composable Cloud (KyRICC). This KyRICC architecture will support complex data analysis pipelines with highly heterogeneous hardware requirements not currently supported by current HPC infrastructures. As a result, this project will enable and support a wide range of new research activities.\n\n\nWhile GPUs have been part of HPC deployments for many years, recent advancements in the application of accelerators across machine learning, omic analysis, and simulation, have greatly increased demand. Accelerator workload diversity has also increased, with large language models requiring multi-node scale for the training and inference of single models. Conversely, reinforcement models, like those used in digital twin simulation, might require many GPU instances, but in a much smaller capacity. It is increasingly important that HPC systems implement features to better adapt available resources to specific workloads.\n\n\nThe Kentucky Research Informatics Composable Cloud (KyRICC) was created to provide flexible yet specialized infrastructure in support modern computational research. KyRICC is composed of five densely connected (IB 4x400Gb/sec + Eth 2x100Gb/sec) nodes NVIDIA DGX nodes, each with 8 X H100 80G GPUs. The total cluster provides 40 x H100 GPUs (3200GB vRAM), 10TB of CPU RAM, 174TB of onboard NVMe storage, and 560 CPU cores. Accompanying computational infrastructure are management and login nodes. While deployed in a secure environment, the cluster is equipped with dual purpose login/data transfer nodes with 100G connectivity to Internet2. Fractions of a node can be isolated for computation or the entire cluster, supporting a wide range of computational needs.     \n\n\nThe compositional features of KyRICC provide a foundation for process, resource, and data isolation. Building on these features KyRICC supports workloads with protected and sensitive data. While the system can be used for general purpose computation, optimized pipelines have been developed and validated for accelerator-dependent workloads, such as large multimodal models, accelerated omics, and digital twin / time-series analysis.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JefferyCTalbert\n"
