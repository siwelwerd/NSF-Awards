 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"On the crossroads of Algebra, Geometry, and Physics\" will take place May 16-20, 2022 at Yale University. The conference will feature talks on recent developments in several interrelated fields, organized broadly around the themes of algebra, geometry, representation theory, and high energy physics. It will catalyze new interactions between experts in these fields. The conference speakers are leading experts who have made fundamental contributions to the topics above, as well as early-career researchers. Participants with a broad range of backgrounds will benefit from the wide spectrum of topics presented at the conference.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the conference is to present current developments on various aspects of geometric representation theory, including the geometric Langlands program and the geometric aspects of the representation theory of quantum groups; cluster theory including motivic Donaldson-Thomas theory and cluster varieties and mirror symmetry; geometry, including higher Teichmueller theory and hyperbolic geometry; and high energy physics including supersymmetric field theories and deformation quantization. The conference website is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/crossroads2022.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
