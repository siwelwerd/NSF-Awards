 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a data-driven approach for reliable operations of high-performance cooling systems that will break through the thermal limitations for high-power-density electronic and energy systems. The proposed technology will not only make an impact on fundamental thermal transport research but also industrial production of electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, power electronics, power generation, etc. By enabling more efficient cooling, reduced energy consumption, and reduced carbon oxide emissions, this technology will benefit both the economy and the environment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of accurate and reliable technology for fault detection of high-performance two-phase cooling systems by coupling high-speed imaging, acoustic emission (AE), with multimodal fusion using deep learning (DL). The technology has fast, real-time, online monitoring and detection providing extremely fast processing of data/images, in the order of 1-10 ns/frame.  The innovation is non-invasive fault detection using contact AE sensor attached to the heater, hydrophones immersed in the working fluid, and high-speed imaging outside the boiling chamber. The innovation uses data-driven anomaly identification via machine learning-based dimensionality reduction, and fusion of multimodal signals. Our technology will leverage optimized model architectures for each modality of signals, e.g., convolutional neural networks for images, recurrent neural networks for time-series signals, and fuse the signals by concatenating the output layer of each channel.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project embarked on a mission to change this narrative by leveraging the power of deep learning and acoustic emissions. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of a non-intrusive method to detect faults in cooling systems. We collected a vast database of acoustic emissions from various cooling systems in different stages of their lifecycle.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the innovative approach to fault detection. The deep learning model achieved a detection accuracy of 95%, proving its efficacy in this application. This outcome shows that acoustic emissions, when analyzed with advanced algorithms, can provide significant insights into the health of machinery, making it possible to predict and prevent failures. The broader impacts of this technology are multifaceted, including economic savings, environmental impact, and safe operations in industrial product lines. By catching faults early, plants can avoid costly shutdowns and repairs. This preventive approach translates to substantial financial savings in industries reliant on cooling systems. Preventing failures in cooling systems ensures that they run efficiently, leading to reduced energy consumption. This reduction directly correlates to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to environmental conservation efforts. This project has delivered two conference papers that detail the further development of the technology in both hardware and software (machine learning model). The customer discoveries include interviews and discussions with 130+ engineers who may be interested in our technology. By analyzing the feedback from the interviewees, we have identified data centers and power electronics as the primary and secondary markets of our technology. Furthermore, encouraged by interviewed electric engineers, we have extended our technology for electrical fault detection and obtained promising results, which not only demonstrates the value of our technology but also highlights the significant role of customer discoveries in product development.
