 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the urgent need for the development of equitable approaches to early childhood STEM education that honor the diverse cultural practices through which caregivers (such as parents, grandparents, and other adults in children\u2019s lives) support young children\u2019s learning. Recent studies suggest that both formal and informal educational institutions often privilege Western or Eurocentric parenting practices, neglecting many families\u2019 cultural practices and ways of learning. This study will bring together a group of caregivers, pre-K educators, researchers, and museum staff to investigate how families with young children negotiate among their own cultural practices and the types of STEM learning they encounter in museums, schools, and other community settings. The project team will work together to identify opportunities for informal STEM learning institutions to strengthen their roles as places that can bridge home and school environments and open up new possibilities for building on caregivers\u2019 knowledge and cultural practices within this larger community context. The project will directly benefit the 330 families whose children attend the partnering public school each year, as well as hundreds of families who attend family events at the New York Hall of Science annually. Finally, by considering nuances in caregivers\u2019 perspectives and experiences based on multiple facets of their identities, the research will reveal how structures in educational settings might be changed to become more inclusive and culturally responsive for the broadest possible audience of families.\r\n\r\nThis Pilots and Feasibility project seeks to 1) conduct exploratory research to understand caregiver engagement, defined as caregivers\u2019 expectations, values, and practices related to their roles in children\u2019s learning, from the perspectives of caregivers, and 2) engage in co-design efforts with caregivers and pre-K educators to explore how the museum can be leveraged as a material and creative resource to support caregiver engagement in STEM learning. This work will be carried out in the context of a long-term partnership between the New York Hall of Science and the New York City Department of Education. Methods will include in-depth interviews with caregivers, using narrative and intersectional research methods to extend existing studies on caregiver engagement in informal STEM learning, while taking into account multiple aspects of families\u2019 social and cultural identities. This work will be carried out in Corona \u2014 a neighborhood in Queens, NY, largely made up of low-income and first-generation immigrant families. The project team will collaboratively interpret findings and engage in the initial phases of co-design work, which will include: reflecting on the systems currently in place to support caregivers\u2019 involvement in children\u2019s learning across settings; collaboratively generating new, culturally responsive strategies for leveraging the museum as a material and creative resource for families with young children; and choosing promising directions for further development and testing. Products from this work will include directions for new caregiver engagement initiatives that can be developed and refined as the partnership continues, and strategies for supporting equitable participation by caregivers, pre-K educators, and other community stakeholders in future research-practice partnerships.\r\n\r\nThis 2-year Pilot and Feasibility study is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to (a) advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments; (b) provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences; (c) advance innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments; and (d) engage the public of all ages in learning STEM in informal environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Group discussions resulted in community-generated directions for new family programs (including topics of interest, and formats for STEM activities that would connect across home, school, and museum environments). These ideas will inform new family engagement initiatives at our museum that will reach families who are enrolled at the Pre-K Center, as well as hundreds of other families each year who visit the museum from other local neighborhoods in Queens and across the greater New York City metro area.\r\n\n\n Beyond the local community at the center of this work, the project has resulted in guidance about how other educational institutions can seek out and integrate caregivers' perspectives into the development of family programs, in order to ensure that these experiences are relevant, culturally responsive, and engaging for diverse family groups. Our findings encourage institutions to define family engagement as a multifaceted and community-wide process, and to leave space for variation in parenting styles, cultural practices, and personal values, all of which influence when and how caregivers are involved in children's learning activities. We have shared our processes for engaging caregivers in discussions about family engagement so that they may be replicated in other communities, and disseminated the outcomes of our collaborative efforts to spark continued discussion about how educational institutions define and work to support family engagement.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SusanMLetourneau\n"
