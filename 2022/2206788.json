 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through a series of NSF sponsored Pioneer Array Innovations Labs, the new location for the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Coastal Array will be relocated to the Southern Mid-Atlantic Bight (S-MAB), in the region between Cape Hatteras, NC, and Norfolk Canyon, VA. In order to inform specific array design decisions, such as mooring siting, spacing, and instrument/sensor selection and configuration it is important to perform ocean numerical modeling analysis of the complex and dynamic ocean circulation to provide guidance to the OOI-CGSN Pioneer Array system design and build group that meets their published milestones/constraints for the design and build-out timeline. The results of this modelling effort would strengthen future model-based co-design of NSF-supported field programs, including the next Pioneer redeployment in another five (5) years. This project offers opportunities to develop strong partnerships with stakeholders in academia, government, and industry sectors, including marine fisheries and offshore renewable energy (wind and hydrokinetic).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI's proposes to perform a suite of numerical modeling investigations and analyses to deliver actionable guidance to the OOI-CGSN Pioneer Array system design and build group that meets their published milestones/constraints for the design and build-out timeline. Skillful ocean modeling and analysis will offer a virtual ocean framework \u2013 a \u201cdigital twin\u201d ocean \u2013 that can be used to inform specific array design decisions, such as mooring siting, spacing, and instrument/sensor selection and configuration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
