 "awd_abstract_narration": "The future of cyber-physical systems are smart technologies that can work collaboratively, cooperatively, and safely with humans. Smart technologies and humans will share autonomy, i.e., the right, obligation  and ability to share control in order to meet their mutual objectives in the environment of operations. For example, surgical robots must interact with surgeons to increase their capabilities in performing high-precision surgeries, drones need to deliver packages to humans and places, and autonomous cars need to share roads with human-driven cars. In all such interactions, these systems must act safely despite the risks and uncertainties that are intrinsic with humans, technologies, and the environments in which they interact. The key insight of this project is that control strategies can be developed that increase safety in situations where a human needs to closely interact with a cyber-physical system (CPS) that is capable of autonomy or semi-autonomous action.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop risk-aware interactive control and planning for achieving safe cyber-physical-human (CPS-h) systems. This project will advance the state-of-the-art of CPS-h planning and control in three main ways: (i) developing computationally tractable risk-aware trajectory planning algorithms that are suited to general autonomous CPS-h, (ii) developing a computationally efficient and empirically supported framework to account for risk-awareness in human\u2019s decision-making, and (iii) deriving interaction-aware planning algorithms for achieving safe and efficient interactions between multiple risk-aware agents. The proposed algorithms will be extensively evaluated with human subjects in interaction with autonomous CPS-h such as autonomous cars and quadcopters. This work will have direct impact on many CPS-h domains including but not limited to multi-agent interactions, autonomous driving, collaboration and coordination between humans and autonomous agents in safety-critical scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
