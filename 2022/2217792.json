The support will be used to more fully enable participation by early career members and students. The conference will allow participants to disseminate results and have discussions surrounding the latest progress in neutrino physics. Neutrino's play a large role in understanding the nature of our universe and are studied both with accelerator and non-accelerator experiments as well as experiments in particle astrophysics. \r\n\r\nThis award will help fund participation in the conference by underrepresented groups by selecting: Early Career members who do not have other funding for the conference; Applicants who are presenting at the conference (talk or poster); and Members of underrepresented groups (women and underrepresented minorities)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
