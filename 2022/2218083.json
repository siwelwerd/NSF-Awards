 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost every living being on Earth has an internal biological clock, known as circadian rhythms, to drive patterns of many important bodily functions, such as sleep-wake cycles in animals. Likewise, all cells rely on another clock, called cell cycles, for precise timing of cell growth and cell division. Although both circadian rhythms and cell cycles have been studied for decades, these biological clocks are themselves complicated networks interacting with other cellular networks to orchestrate various downstream events and are frequently connected to diseases from insomnia to cancer. The complexity of these systems makes it very difficult to isolate the core machinery to understand their minimized requirements. This project aims to make further major advances in the direction of understanding cellular oscillations by reconstituting and investigating minimal cell-cycle clock systems in synthetic cells. The knowledge gained from this research is disseminated to the broader community through publications, conferences, courses, and hands-on demonstrations. The major broader impact activities involve the early exposure of underrepresented students to frontier research and retention of these students in STEM fields. College level students are introduced to the state-of-the-art technology developed in this project. The project also develops and implements outreach programs to disseminate the scientific findings to the broader public through the collaborations with the University of Michigan Museum of National History. \r\n\r\nBiological oscillators, including the cell cycle, have a significant impact on the ability of organisms to establish morphogenetic patterns in embryos and maintain basic physiology in adults. It is thus crucial to understand the design and function of these biological clocks. Such understanding provides fundamental knowledge of development and guidance to create synthetic oscillators. Despite its importance, the minimized design principles for constructing versatile and resilient oscillators remains elusive. This research combines several strategies to ascertain the essential rules underlying a fundamental out-of-equilibrium process, the mitotic cell cycles. Specifically, the project builds a unique synthetic cell system, using microemulsion droplets, to dissect the circuit-function relation of an in vitro cell-cycle network and uses the knowledge gained to create a minimized cell-cycle network from the bottom up. The synthetic cellular system is composed of the smallest possible sets of proteins, mRNAs, and ATP as the energy source. A successful project will provide significant insights into the minimal requirements of the network topology that is responsible for the desired cell-cycle performance and response to environmental perturbations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
