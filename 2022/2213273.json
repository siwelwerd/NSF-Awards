 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). In this project, Professor Beck and his students at Eastern Illinois University (EIU) intend to develop chemical groups that can direct attached molecules to the peroxisomes, an understudied region of cells that has an important role in a variety of cellular processes. The new chemical approaches and tools developed in this project have the potential to enable detailed study of the biochemical reactions that take place in the peroxisomes of living cells. Successful implementation of this project will also broaden participation of students underrepresented in STEM fields by providing paid research opportunities for students and strengthening the Inclusiveness in STEM (iSTEM) program at EIU. The iSTEM program is designed to provide these students more opportunities to interact with potential role models and mentors.\r\n\r\nProf. Beck and his team intend to adapt peroxisome targeting peptide sequences to develop modular moieties that can target pendant small molecule cargoes to the peroxisomes. Successful implementation of this research will result in the characterization peroxisome interaction moieties (PIMs). Properties include cell permeability, interaction of key components of the peroxisome import mechanism, and the ability to direct previously untargeted compounds to the peroxisomes. PIMs will then be used to generate fluorogenic probes to monitor hydrogen peroxide production in the peroxisomes. An expected outcome of the project is to assist students in developing the connections and skills they need to be successful in their future studies and/or careers in STEM while making significant scientific contributions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
