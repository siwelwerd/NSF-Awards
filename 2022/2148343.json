 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics is key to understanding science and engineering. Recent neuroscience evidence suggests that language and mathematics are processed in different parts of the brain. How do children learn mathematical concepts? The research in this project studies the universal neural and cognitive bases of mathematics in young children and measures the biological and environmental factors that lead to individual variations in mathematical cognition. By non-invasively measuring brain activity in young (4-8 year-old) children, this novel study will assess for the first time, how neural representations of numbers and spatial concepts change over time as children develop greater capacity with mathematics, and how patterns of brain activation relate to children\u2019s mathematical competence in school. This is important because educational studies show that early proficiency in mathematics can predict later success in mathematics. In addition to studying the neural basis for math processing in all children, the researchers also seek to discover whether there are differences in the ways that boys and girls learn mathematics. To this end, the project explores the impact of gender as well as the learning environment on children. The study specifically aims to test the hypothesis that boys and girls exhibit similar patterns of neural development during mathematical learning in early childhood (4-6 years-of-age, and that later gender differences begin to emerge (around 7-8 years-of-age) and are limited to specific areas (spatial skills) that are influenced by socialization.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop a full picture of mathematical learning, aptitude and outcomes in childhood, the proposal collects longitudinal functional magnetic brain imaging (fMRI) data in young children, as well as multiple behavioral tests and also track scholastic performance. The researchers will seek to define the brain networks that are selectively activated during mathematical cognition. To rigorously test for possible gender differences, the proposal will utilize new statistical approaches. This research is highly relevant at a societal level, because despite equal levels of ability among boys and girls, a math gap grows over time as girls are discouraged and tracked away from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) subjects. By the time students reach college, women are significantly underrepresented in STEM majors. The results of this study will lead to deeper insights which will have profound implications for child education. This study will also have the potential for influencing educational policy and will encourage all children, especially girls, to engage with math and science in school.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
