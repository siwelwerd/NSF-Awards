 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced cyberinfrastructures seek to make streaming data a modality for the scientific community by offering rich sensing capabilities across the edge-to-Cloud Computing Continuum. For societal applications based on multiple geo-distributed data sources and sophisticated data analytics, such as wildfire detection or personal safety, these platforms can be incredibly transformative. However, it is challenging to match user constraints (response time, quality, energy) with what is feasible in a heterogeneous and dynamic computation environment coupled with uncertainty in the availability of data. Identifying events and accelerating responses critically depends on the capacity to select resources and configure services under uncertain operating conditions. This project develops software abstractions that react at runtime to unforeseen events, and adaptation of the resources and computing paths between the edge and the cloud. This research is driven by the unique capabilities of the SAGE cyberinfrastructure as a case study to explore data-driven reactive behaviors at the network's edge on a national scale. \r\n\r\nThe project proposes intelligent services to drive computing optimization from urgent scenarios on large cyberinfrastructures.  The project focuses on resource management and programming support around three interrelated tasks: (1) developing models for capturing the dynamics of edge resources; (2) researching software abstractions for reactive analytics; and (3) addressing cost/benefit tradeoffs to drive the autonomous reconfiguration of applications and resources under constraints. The outcomes are intended to directly extend the SAGE platform and provide artifacts for creating urgent analytics, which will benefit SAGE users and the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
