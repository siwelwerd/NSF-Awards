 "awd_abstract_narration": "Has Recent Tectono-Magmatic Activity at L\u014d\u02bbihi (Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa) Seamount perturbed vent-fluid circulation and hydrothermal Fe export to the ocean?\r\n\r\n\r\nLike volcanoes on land, submarine volcanoes are not continuously erupting but can remain dormant for long periods. Even while dormant, however, the magmatic heat present beneath a volcano\u2019s surface can continue to drive hot springs in between eruptions. The focus of this study is hot springs at the Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa underwater volcano (previously known as L\u014d\u02bbihi), situated about 30 miles south of the Big Island of Hawai\u2019i which last erupted in 1996. Prior studies between the mid 2000\u2019s and late 2010\u2019s have shown that the multiple hot-springs associated with that last eruption, at the summit of the volcano have been cooling down continuously. This study will investigate whether two sets of recent earthquakes at Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa may have altered that cooling trend. In May 2020 earthquakes associated with magma intrusion into the chamber deep within the seamount were detected. In 1996 earthquakes similar to this accompanied a volcanic eruption. More recently still, in December 2021 the strongest earthquakes of any kind since the 1996 eruption were detected. This project will use a deep-diving robot to investigate whether lava was erupted on the seafloor during these earthquakes and also if the composition of the fluids (chemically altered seawater) flowing out of the seafloor at the volcano\u2019s summit has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe L\u014d\u02bbihi seamount (recently renamed Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa) last erupted in 1996, significantly reshaping its summit and creating three collapse pits.  Inside one of these, Pele\u2019s Pit, hot springs have been studied which exhibited temperatures in excess of 200\u00b0C immediately post-eruption.  Since 2006, however, the multiple sites that have been subject to long-term study within Pele\u2019s Pit and around its rim have shown more modest temperatures of 15-55\u00b0C which, further, have exhibited progressive cooling at a rate of 1-2\u00b0C over a 12-year period from 2006 to 2018 (the most recent year for which time-series data exist).  Thermodynamic modeling of the fluids collected in 2018 has provided new insight that the subsurface hydrothermal circulation within this steep sided seamount may extend much deeper than is typical at mid-ocean ridges (which are more elongate and exhibit shallower-sloping ridge flanks). Further, a geochemical consequence of L\u014d\u02bbihi\u2019s unusual circulation pattern may account for the unusually Fe-rich nature of the vent-fluids emerging from the seafloor at this intra-plate setting, and their impact on the surrounding ocean, when compared to mid-ocean ridges vents. This project will extend the 2006-2018 time-series of vent studies at L\u014d\u02bbihi to investigate whether the subsurface hydrothermal circulation system has been perturbed by two significant episodes of seismicity that have subsequently occurred, as detected by the US Geological Survey\u2019s Hawai\u2019i Volcano Observatory.  In May 2020, a swarm of earthquakes was detected that were distinctive compared to all seismic activity since the volcano last erupted in May 1996 because they exhibited T-phase activity, recognized as being diagnostic of magmatic fluids migrating within the interior of the seamount and potentially indicative of magma replenishment. In December 2021, an even more pronounced episode of seismicity was detected, up to magnitude M4.9, which matched the strongest earthquakes detected during the 1996 eruptions. This project will use the ROV Jason to investigate whether the seafloor hydrothermal venting at L\u014d\u02bbihi has been perturbed following these episodes of seismicity.  The project will test the hypothesis that the earthquakes, detected by T-phase seismic signals, perturbed the deep hydrothermal circulation cell at L\u014d\u02bbihi, which in turn should be detectable at the seafloor through changes in vent-fluid temperatures and geochemical compositions.  Changes in seafloor morphology and locations of vent-sites compared to the previous ROV dives in 2018 may also be expected.  Conversely, the null hypothesis would be that the vent-sites that have been studied since 2006 continue to cool progressively (each vent should then be 6\u00b12\u00b0C cooler than when last studied in 2018) with compositions that will have changed accordingly.  Importantly, proving this null hypothesis would still be scientifically valuable.  It would extend the longest time series available for any intra-plate hydrothermal field worldwide and continue to collect pre-event data in anticipation of future extrusive volcanism at L\u014d\u02bbihi that will occur.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project used a robotic underwater vehicle to visit the floor of a submarine crater offshore from the Big Island of Hawaii. The crater is at the summit of an active underwater volcano (seamount) where volcanic eruptions last occurred in 1996. Even while dormant, submarine hot springs had been observed and monitored in and around the summit craters of that seamount for the ensuing 20+ years, including, most recently, this teams expedition in 2018. The motivation for our 2023 return was that the US Geological Survey had reported two sets of large earthquakes (unlike anything detected since the 1996 eruptions) associated with this seamount, in May of 2020 and again in December 2021. Despite a long backlog of field expeditions that needed to be scheduled following the COVID-19 pandemic, we were afforded a short cruise in January 2023 to investigate whether any changes were evident. At the one vent site that we had the opportunity to revisit, close to the wall of the summit crater, conditions seemed very similar to our 2018 investigations. But at both that location and at the crater floor we found clear evidence for fresh volcanic activity with rock formations that were not present in 2018. Further, the new lavas in the floor of the crater also hosted new submarine vent systems that were not present in 2018. We were able to collect samples of rock and vent-fluid from this new setting for multi-disciplinary studies following the cruise. Perhaps the single biggest scientific outcome of the project has been that the vent-fluids were relatively unchanged compared to 2018. This has required to revisit ideas that we had only formulated since 2018 on how the plumbing system for the flow of hot water beneath the volcanic seafloor must function. A further episode of seismicity in Spring 2023, following our field expedition, reminds us that change may be continuing  certainly the extent of new lava flows witnessed in our work is much much less than the 1996 eruptions leading us to hypothesize that the system is probably in the pre-eruption phase, stimulating us to seek opportunities to return. As well as the scientific outcomes of this project, our work also had some important broader impacts. First, we were able to hold a competition to take 9 early career scientists who had not previously had the opportunity to join a deep ocean research project out to sea with us. More than 200 candidates applied for that opportunity. Second, we were also able to invite a resident artist, Rebecca Rutstein, to join our expedition. Her work has resulted in a series of 9 pieces (acrylic on canvas, 18 x 18) inspired by everything from mapping the shape of the seafloor volcano to the microbes that dominate the fauna around the hotsprings that we visited. That series has already been displayed in 3 different venues, to-date.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChrisGerman\n"
