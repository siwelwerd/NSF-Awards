This will be a hybrid meeting with approximately 120 in-person attendees (up to 200 attendees including the virtual component). The workshop will facilitate the exchange of ideas between junior and senior researchers in electronic structure theory and serve as an opportunity for creating new collaborations. The workshop will focus on the latest developments in electronic structure theory and computational materials science. The simulation techniques covered by the workshop are used across a variety of fields including physics, chemistry, and materials science, both in academia and in industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
