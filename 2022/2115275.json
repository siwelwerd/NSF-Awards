 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning grant will address the challenge of responding to sea level rise (SLR) in linked urban-rural systems located along the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Region (GCR). Urban and rural areas in the GCR are part of a geographical continuum composed of interdependent nodes connected by synergistic linkages, wherein the urban areas depend on the rural areas for natural resources and the rural areas depend on the urban areas for services. SLR threatens the links that bind urban and rural communities together in the GCR. Compared with much of the world, the rate of SLR is quite high across much of the GCR and its landscape is a relatively low-lying coastal plain. Moreover, disadvantaged minority groups compose a large fraction of both the urban and rural population in this region, yielding a high degree of social vulnerability. The typical SLR response strategies in the GCR are often practiced differentially across urban versus rural areas. The aim of this planning grant is to build a consolidated SLR adaptation strategy that enables urban and rural communities to collaboratively sustain the natural and physical infrastructure that links them together. \r\n\r\nThe proposed approach will be driven by convergent research of experts and by co-production of knowledge and ideas from stakeholder engagement. The project team will bring together an inclusive and diverse group of researchers, community leaders, and policy makers who do not normally interact. This group will create convergent research outputs and foster stakeholder relationships to build a collaborative Track 1 Sustainable Regional Systems Research Networks (SRS-RN) proposal. The execution of this effort will follow a trajectory with three phases: (1) an on-line high-performance charrette will be used to coordinate partnering researchers and stakeholders, and assemble the foundations of the network, (2) an in-person charrette will be used to co-produce research priorities and hypotheses for the proposed SRS-RN, (3) a concentered expert workshop will integrate these efforts and synthesize the output products. This planning grant is a unique opportunity to (a) coalesce interdisciplinary teams, focus on the commonalities at the urban-rural linkages, (b) identify priorities, needs, and incentives of diverse stakeholders, (c) build knowledge and trust across these communities, and (d) formulate the research objectives, hypotheses, and methods for an innovative research network structure. Network activities will focus on the inclusion of minority constituencies, groups, and institutions that have been historically excluded from the SLR response conversation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It explored new research topics and was a nexus for building capacity among researchers and communities affected by sea level rise, leading towards several convergent outcomes. Aligning with the 2012 RESTORE Act, we defined the US portion of the GCR as the 700,000 square km coastal portions of the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and all of Florida. While an increasing number of researchers and practitioners have focused on developing adaptation strategies, they have often been narrow in scope or focused on a particular problem or risk. Typically, the common-denominator solution has been to install site-specific defenses. However, the highly variable spatial and temporal nature of sea-level rise (SLR) requires comprehensive, collaborative, and robust planning across a region to successfully defend the territory and coordinate various interests with a consolidated front.
