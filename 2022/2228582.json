 "awd_abstract_narration": "Persisting gaps in pain care is the problem to be addressed in this project. We intend to build an expert community team to create online resources that will be freely available to aid people with pain. The opioid crisis has heightened public awareness about the risks of relying on opioids alone for pain relief. Despite that online pain management programs have been found to improve pain, reduce opioid use and misuse, and increase use of non-opioid pain management options, they are not always available for people who need the help. More attention is needed to create programs that can be accessed for all. This projet will include input from healthcare providers and the public to create resources for people with pain. The aim with this work is to advance the science on use of technology to assist with a public health problem. The end goal is to create an up-to-date, accessible program that will improve pain care outcomes. The project will also investigate new ways to keep the online pain program updated and current, noting that the cost of technology maintenance is an obstacle. This project expects our project could improve pain care for people and, potentially, result in fewer problems from poorly managed pain, such as suicide, opioid misuse, or overdose. Creation of a successful open-access model could result in an innovation that can be easily replicable and widely shared in other communities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Stage 1 planning grant is to build a network of community collaborators to work together towards a shared goal of improving pain management outcomes. This project will first solidify an advisory board to direct all aspects of the project. We will then seek input from people with pain, healthcare providers, and community members on desired features and content of an online suite of pain management resources (E-health). The project will use surveys and focus group methods to collect diverse feedback. Technology tools are often created, but resources to maintain and embed them in clinical settings are often insufficient. Therefore, this project will also investigate options for ongoing sustainability of the online resources during our data gathering stage. The project team will ask the advisory board to review summaries of the gathered data after analysis. Together, the research team and advisory board will draft a prototype and cost estimate for an E-health suite that can be fully developed, and pilot tested in a Stage 2 project.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2014Track B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs\u2014and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
