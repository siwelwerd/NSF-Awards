Universality is ubiquitous in physical phenomena: a magnet and a liquid, while very different systems, are governed by the same principles near their phase transitions. While the notion of universality is well established in equilibrium, universal aspects of non-equilibrium quantum systems have remained largely elusive, owing to their vast variety and rich dynamics. In this project, the PI and his team will investigate two general settings of isolated quantum systems and open quantum systems coupled to an environment. The latter systems have emerged not only as a new paradigm for realizing novel phases of matter but also as a leading platform for quantum computation. The research team will revisit and extend the principles of statistical mechanics to quantum systems far from equilibrium, using connections to quantum information, and closely collaborating with experimental groups to realize the emerging universal dynamics in experiments. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of the research will benefit other disciplines from classical non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to quantum information science and technology, in synergy with the research activities. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students in the research projects, this award also supports the PI's outreach activities to the general public. These include (i) the organization of the new phase of the \u201cSchroedinger's Cat is in Town!\u201d workshop series that brings together physicists, artists and the public to communicate physics through art at Michigan State University Broad Museum Art Lab, and (ii) the launch of the next phase of the interactive simulation website \u201cBohring Art\u201d, which is a collaborative project with Science Gallery Detroit, that will convey the modern face of quantum physics to young science enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities focused on the universal dynamics of quantum many-body systems that are far from equilibrium. Non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems are particularly challenging systems to study: They come in an astonishing variety; they often exhibit an effectively classical behavior; overarching equilibrium paradigms such as time reversal symmetry, fluctuation-dissipation relations, quantum-to-classical mapping are unavailable far from equilibrium; and beyond one dimension or small systems, exact numerical techniques are extremely difficult. These fundamental challenges are particularly relevant in the new era of non-equilibrium quantum systems, afforded by the remarkable progress in quantum simulation platforms as well as ultrafast experiments in condensed matter systems. \r\n\r\nIn this project, the PI and his team will identify the universal dynamics of quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium. The research will be conducted for two generic non-equilibrium settings of isolated systems after a sudden quench and driven-dissipative quantum systems characterized by an external drive and relaxation due to coupling to environment. The latter is emerging as a leading platform in quantum computation, and will be the larger focus of this project. The PI will expand the toolbox of non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, characterize scenarios that evade an effectively classical behavior, and elucidate the emergence of time reversal far from equilibrium.  \r\n\r\nThe outcome of the research will benefit other disciplines from classical non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to quantum information science and technology, in synergy with the research activities. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students in the research projects, this award also supports the PI's outreach activities to the general public.
