 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nQuantum information science and its related technologies have the potential to generate breakthrough technologies for communication, sensing, and computing. Recent discoveries by the principal investigators of this project demonstrate that quantum interactions in multiphoton systems offer the potential to process large amounts of information with unprecedented speeds. However, successful demonstration of realistic quantum photonic technologies significantly depends on the possibility of developing platforms that are robust against dissipative environments. This research introduces and experimentally characterizes a new paradigm of robust quantum devices based on multiphoton interactions in photonic lattices with engineered dissipative mechanisms. The project develops a highly trained workforce in quantum information science that originates in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. This is accomplished by numerous, interdisciplinary education and outreach activities, including a Scholar Academy between the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), the Louisiana State University (LSU), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  \r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe multiple scattering and interference interactions that can take place in multiphoton systems offer the potential for breakthrough technologies in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE). However, a major obstacle in developing realistic quantum technologies is the decoherence of any quantum system when exposed to dissipative environments. In this project, a pioneering team in QISE research at UTRGV, LSU, and UCLA introduces and experimentally characterizes a new paradigm of robust quantum photonic devices. This approach exploits the distinctive features of the parity and time-reversal symmetry breaking at exceptional points of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in multiphoton systems, and provides exquisite control of decoherence through novel multiphoton interactions that have not been accounted for in conventional quantum optics. The innovative idea is to engineer losses to increase the channel capacity of a quantum photonic device. This research takes the dynamics of multiphoton scattering from its fundamental physics to the development of complex quantum devices for information processing. It demonstrates for the first time the potential of non-Hermitian systems for the design of quantum photonic lattices in which nonclassical multiparticle dynamics is preserved. This paradigm is realized by introducing new theoretical and computational tools, the experimental implementation of multiparticle state transport protocols, and their verification through quantum state tomography in photonic lattices. The experimental milestones of this project exploit unique experimental capabilities in the United States, such as sources of entangled multiphoton states and novel detection schemes for the characterization of multiparticle systems. The educational activities of this project create an academic pipeline between UTRGV, LSU, and UCLA in terms of a Scholar Academy for all students participating in the project. Existing undergraduate and graduate-level outreach activities at UTRGV are transformed to create new opportunities for the education of underrepresented minority groups in QISE. This project serves as a nucleus to establish sustainable QISE research and education at UTRGV to contribute to a cultural change in graduate education in the Rio Grande Valley region in South Texas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
