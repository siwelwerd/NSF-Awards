Phytoplankton are microscopic organisms responsible for half of the global photosynthetic carbon fixation and at least half of the world\u2019s oxygen production. However, certain kinds of phytoplankton can produce powerful biotoxins that harm humans and wildlife, contaminate water sources, and damage local economies. Sensors for phytoplankton toxin production are a critical infrastructure needed to advance both fundamental research and climate resilience. However, current methods of studying phytoplankton toxins and their genes are based on methods that are costly, require sophisticated infrastructure, and lack remote, real-time detection capabilities central to understanding the dynamics of the coupled water/climate ecosystem. This project addresses this gap by developing a new optical measurement technique that uses nanostructured silicon surfaces to amplify light for sensitive detection of target molecules. This project will support the postdoctoral research fellow, includes training of undergraduates from primarily undergraduate institutions, and seeks to contribute key resources and data for better resource management and public water stewardship.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic photosynthetic organisms, phytoplankton, are an essential part of the earth\u2019s carbon cycle and are critical to driving biogeochemical cycles. But under certain conditions, phytoplankton can undergo explosive growth forming dense blooms called harmful algal blooms (HABs) that can cover hundreds of square kilometers and produce powerful biotoxins. Understanding how environmental drivers impact plankton nutrient cycling and toxin production is key to advancing climate resilience but remains an outstanding measurement challenge. Methods of monitoring HABs and understanding toxin dynamics are largely based on microscopy, mass spectroscopy, and PCR; techniques that are time consuming, require sophisticated infrastructure, and lack the real-time in situ detection capabilities necessary to understand how the physicochemical environment drives phytoplankton metabolic dynamics in a changing ecosystem. This postdoctoral fellowship aims to address this gap by developing high quality factor (high-Q) nanophotonics for sensitive, quantitative, amplification-free, and label-free detection of aquatic phycotoxins in near real-time and in situ. Rather than amplifying a biomolecule to successfully detect it, high-Q metasurfaces use nanostructured silicon to strongly amplify laser light at molecular binding sites to enable sensitive detection of target molecules in a scalable, highly multiplexed, all-optical platform with a compact footprint. This postdoctoral fellowship will focus on two phycotoxins: domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the marine diatoms, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., that is responsible for human and wildlife mortalities, and microcystin, a liver toxin produced by cyanobacteria and that poses a major threat to drinking, recreational, and agricultural water supplies. While domoic acid is a low molecular weight L- proline derivative, microcystin is a relatively large cyclic peptide; together these two prevalent phycotoxins will demonstrate the broad applicability of this technique across marine metabolites and diverse environments. Together, this research will enable real-time quantitative detection of phycotoxins over a large range of concentrations and environmental conditions. The outputs of this work will be an avenue for real-time measurements of phycotoxins, which can be combined with and interpreted in the context of correlative measurements of temperature, pH, and chlorophyll fluorescence, deepening our fundamental understanding of how changing climate conditions drive phytoplankton productivity and toxin production.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A new structure for high-density high-Q metasurface antenna pixels were designed using full-field electromagnetic simulations. Each high-Q antenna is comprised of sub-wavelength silicon nanoblocks that trap and strongly amplify incident light in a &lt;15 micron sensing pixel. The introduction of bi-periodic perturbations to the lateral block dimension combined with photonic mirrors overcomes a key tradeoff between sensitivity and size of each sensing element, reducing the footprint by 10X and the sensitivity by 1.5X. The resulting optical antennas can be densely patterned in arrays of one million sensing pixels per square-centimeter. A new cross-polarized optical microscope was developed, capable of imaging thousands of sensing pixels simultaneously for high-throughput data collection. This research further developed selective chemical assays to bind target toxins to the sensor surface using step-wise self-assembled monolayers and a compettivie antibody binding assay to detect target phycotoxins. This fellowship funded outreach and dissemination of these results at multiple national and international conferences (Gordon Research Conference, Materials Research Society), and participation in programs and workshops promoting culturally inclusive mentoring, diversity and equity in ocean sciences, and in coastal resource management. The funding for this fellowship was ended after three months upon PI&rsquo;s acceptance of the HHMI Hanna H Grey Fellowship.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/11/2023<br>\nModified by: Halleh&nbsp;B&nbsp;Balch</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
