 "awd_abstract_narration": "Market analyses show that battery electric vehicles (BEV) will make up over 25% of the automotive and light vehicle fleet in the United States by 2030.  The global BEV market share is expected to exceed 30% of all vehicles on the road.  The increased power demand generated by this growth will require greater efficiency in the generation and delivery of electricity to the US market.  Central to this efficiency will be the vehicle-to-grid interface (V2G) commonly referred to as the \u201celectric vehicle charging station\u201d.  Energy producers, government entities, and industry will all require employees with an understanding of the impact of BEVs on the electrical supply grid and the impact of the supply grid on the operation of BEVs.  This project at Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) seeks to address the critical need for electricians and technicians with applicable knowledge of the V2G interface.  The project will meet this need by (1) developing educational modules to train electricians in the theory and operation of BEV charging systems, and (2) training automotive/light truck technicians in the theory and operation of electrical generation and supply grids.  HVCC will develop BEV charging system educational modules that can be easily and efficiently integrated into existing degree programs, and make these training modules widely available for implementation by other educational institutions throughout the country.  The project team expects that addressing the knowledge gaps in V2G theory and operation will greatly increase the population of technicians prepared to perform the critical services necessary to support the country\u2019s transition to electric vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis project will enable HVCC to develop training modules that will address significant knowledge gaps in trades critical to the country\u2019s transition to a BEV fleet.  An estimated 200 students will complete degree programs in areas directly impacted by V2G, including automotive repair, electrical construction and maintenance, and green technology management.  Additionally, 14 high school, community college, and trade educators serving students in traditionally underserved communities will be trained in V2G theory and operation.  The educational modules developed through this project will be shared with educational programs throughout the country through existing NSF/ATE supported conferences and data bases, the State University of New York system, and professional trade and industry conferences.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technology Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
