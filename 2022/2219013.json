 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tissue engineering is a thought-provoking concept made compelling by the need to replace failed, damaged, or defective body parts. Unlike the more mature field of traditional medical-device development (e.g., joint replacement), tissue engineering is young and evolving. This project can thus change the established tissue-engineering paradigm to not only address the development of healthy tissue (associated with healing) but simultaneously address the need to inhibit bacterial colonization (associated with infection). \r\n\r\nA convergent team of researchers with expertise in microbiology, polymer science, biomaterials science, computational chemistry, veterinary medicine, and medical-device development will develop a new and flexible approach to infection control within a resorbable scaffold for tissue engineering. The research plan encorporates three synergistic research thrusts which will converge around a specific testbed, namely a new scaffold designed to regrow hard tissue that simultaneously resists bacterial colonization. To mimic the extracellular matrix, Thrust 1 will exploit 3D printing to additively create fiber-based scaffolds with controllable fiber size/spacing using combinations of resorbable polymers together with signaling factors to influence stem-cell differentiation. Thrust 2, using synergistic computational and experimental approaches, will explore fundamental concepts of polyelectrolyte complexation and directed self-assembly to render these scaffolds self-defensive (able to release antimicrobials only if, when, and where there is a bacterial challenge). Thrust 3 will employ lab-on-a-chip concepts to understand the competition between mammalian cells and bacteria and, in Phase 2 of project, include small-animal infection models able to recapitulate a complex physiological response.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
