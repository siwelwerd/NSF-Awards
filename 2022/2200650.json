 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Winston Salem State University supports faculty and undergraduate research experiences investigating perfluoroalkyl-substance (PFAS), a class of frequently used environmental toxins. Specifically, a comprehensive analysis, utilizing different experimental techniques, will be used to assess PFAS-induced changes in mitochondrial function, wherein the mitochondrion serves as an endogenous biosensor to environment stimuli and functions as a key indicator of cell health.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the effect of PFASs on multiscale structure-function (structural, cellular, and molecular) of the subcellular organelle, mitochondrion in biological systems. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) examine and visualize PFAS-induced effects on mitochondrion structural dynamics utilizing light sheet microscopy; 2) determine PFAS-induced effects on mitochondrial metabolic changes at the cellular level using novel mass cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting; and 3) identify and characterize PFAS-mediated molecular signatures associated with mitochondria dysfunction using genomic and proteomic approaches. This study will result in understanding the mechanism underlying short and long-term response effects of environmental PFASs on cells. The proposed research will may inform long-term efforts for risk assessment and toxicity of the PFAS on biological systems and environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
