 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project investigates how powerful actors, narrative and regional identities come together to support or hinder just energy transitions. The research focuses on hybrid energy initiatives, defined as initiatives that use former fossil fuel infrastructure and landscapes to house clean technologies or create green jobs. Examples of hybrid energy initiatives include projects and programs that clean-up inactive oil and gas wells, repurpose fossil fuel brownfields for renewable energy production, or recover critical minerals from fossil fuel waste. By analyzing the policies, narratives, and power dynamics associated with hybrid energy transitions this project informs programs and policies toward stronger and more resilient energy transitions.\r\n\r\nThe project draws on political ecology and science and technology studies in a cross-national comparative study that employs qualitative and computational methods. The research asks two main questions: (1) what are the origins, power structures and policies enabling energy transitions in the two regions and are they meeting equity and justice goals? (2) how are perceptions of energy production and use in the future influenced by powerful actors, regional identities, and material conditions? A final analysis uncovers competing visions of the future, how they are formed, and how they gain strength. Energy transitions have potential to address environmental challenges related to fossil fuel production and consumption. They also present windows of opportunity to address issues related to equality and justice. A comparison of the two regions draws normative and policy relevant conclusions toward the achievement of more resilient and just energy transitions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
