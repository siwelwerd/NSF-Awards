A wide range of topics are vulnerable to misinformation, varying from medical misinformation to political misinformation. Accounts that spread misinformation can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) those who do so unintentionally (i.e., individuals who believe in the misinformation that they spread) and (2) those who do so with the aim of being deliberately deceptive (i.e., agents of disinformation \u201cmasquerading\u201d as humans). Those in the former category typically spread misinformation on a constrained number of topics (i.e., either medical or political, but not both), focusing on what they care about as individuals. However, agents of disinformation may be incentivized by malicious third-party actors to spread misinformation across an unconstrained variety of topics, with the objective of prompting widespread instability among the general public. This project analyzes misinformation spread on social media to distinguish third-party-incentivized agents of disinformation from other, more benign accounts.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, the team will examine data from Twitter to identify accounts that switched rapidly between spreading medical misinformation to spreading political misinformation during the first half of 2022. A machine learning framework will be designed to learn from linguistic features that are unique to this subset of accounts, which will then be used to develop a classification tool to label accounts across the broader Twittersphere (i.e., pre-2022 and post-2022) as \u201cpotential agents of disinformation\u201d. The team will also characterize what fraction of misinformation spread during the first half of 2022 was attributable to such third-party-incentivized agents. All algorithms developed over the course of the project will be shared openly with the broader scientific community to facilitate efforts towards countering disinformation on social media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
