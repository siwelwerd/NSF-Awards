 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a post-processing method to dramatically improve properties, including a flexible geometry and inexpensive low-volume production. Additive manufacturing opens revolutionary opportunities for fabricating complex geometries and lowering the cost of low-volume production. However, the impact has been restrained by the low toughness/ductility of AM polymer parts. This project is expected to substantially expand the impact of the existing AM manufacturing base for polymers. The geometric flexibility of low volume AM will enable new customized products. This can allow new opportunities such as increased customization of medical device components to individual patients. It will also be especially value in lowering the costs of maintaining out-of-production equipment and reduce supply chain challenges in distant locations.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a method to post-process parts from existing commercial processes to achieve dramatic property enhancements. The post-processing polymer powder bed fusion components increase ductility, isotropy, and toughness. The technology is applicable to all commercial products or polymer powder bed fusion and is expected to apply to a wide range of polymer materials. The system has been demonstrated in the lab to achieve significant property improvements. This project would identify the potential customers for this capability and quantify the value that it would add for customers. Additionally, the project will explore the different business models available for commercializing the technology to assess the most feasible commercialization paths for transitioning this ability from the lab to production.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOne of the persistent challenges in additive manufacturing (3D Printing) with polymers is that the printed parts are much more brittle than when the very same materials are used in traditional manufacturing processes. In prior NSF-supported research, we demonstrated that the total time that the part temperature is above their melting point is a crucial factor in determining the toughness of the polymers. However, most 3D printing processes cannot hold the high temperature without reducing accuracy and/or significantly increasing the printing time. The goal of this project was to assess the commercial potential of a method to improve the toughness of the 3D printed plastic parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThe iCorp project focuses on testing hypotheses for different business models that could leverage the fundamental research discoveries. This project studied these tradeoffs through interviewing potential customers, suppliers, and users of the technology. Through these interviews, potential applications in automotive and aerospace were identified. IN the automotive industry, the brittleness of 3D printed plastic parts at low temperatures is a primary obstacle to their use even in product development processes. The automotive industry appeared to be particularly promising if the proposed methods can be demonstrated to improve the cold temperature toughness of 3D printed parts.\n\n\nThe research also identified that it is critical to measure the ability of the process to preserve geometric accuracy during the part post processing and to minimize labor during processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThis project provided training in technology commercialization to two graduate students. While they elected not to commercialize this specific technology, both are putting these skills to direct use. One is working as a technology development consultant and the other is a director of research and development for a small startup that was founded from a prior iCorp project. This project has also supported training of four undergraduate students that conducted experiments to help address technical questions that were identified as critical to a minimum viable product.\n\n\nIn addition to the training opportunities, this has identified a commercial opportunity that may yet be exploited by future teams or by new technologies to increase the impact of 3D printing on domestic manufacturing capabilities and speed product development.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NathanBCrane\n"
