 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site Renewal at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign seeks to develop and support STEM leaders in the area of power optimization of electrified mobile systems. In order to maintain the nation\u2019s global competitiveness in science and engineering, the U.S. needs a strong STEM workforce with leaders representative of all American populations. The mega-trend of electrification in the vehicle, construction, and aircraft sectors is driving up demand for students trained in the high-powered, electrified mobility space.  This REU Site will offer a 10-week summer research experience with integrated personal and professional development opportunities to prepare students for entering top-tier STEM graduate programs. Participating students will be recruited from a broad range of institutions and populations. The long-term outcome will be a scientific workforce impacting how mobile, high-powered, electrified products are designed and manufactured. \r\n\r\nThis three-year REU Site Renewal at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign seeks to develop and support STEM leaders in the area of power optimization of electrified mobile systems. The REU Site will recruit 14 undergraduate students per year from schools with limited research opportunities. Students will be trained in interdisciplinary research through team-based projects around the research themes of the Engineering Research Center for the Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems. Mentored by experienced faculty and trained graduate students, the POETS REUs will gain an authentic research experience that is customized to students\u2019 interest and skill level. Technical, professional, and personal development training will be integrated with the goal of increasing students\u2019 higher-order engineering skills, scientific identity, and self-efficacy. The development of STEM leaders will utilize a T-shaped training approach with two aims: building, strengthening and supporting students\u2019 depth of expertise in engineering practices and broadening students\u2019 skill set and experiences through activities focused on graduate school preparedness. Students will also lead a K-12 outreach activity to practice their leadership skills and attend conferences to a build their STEM network.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
