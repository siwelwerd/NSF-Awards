 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2022-2024 BLAST conferences will be the 12th through 14th in a series of yearly international meetings devoted to the foundations of mathematics, with the BLAST 2022 meeting being held from August 8 to 12 at Chapman University in Orange, California. The BLAST conference series features talks and tutorials on current advances in foundations, with focus on Boolean algebra, lattice theory, algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-theoretic topology. The University of North Carolina will host the 2023 meeting and the University of North Texas will host the 2024 meeting.\r\n\r\nThe BLAST conferences are a forum for mathematicians interested in the foundations of mathematics to disseminate their latest results, to collaborate and exchange ideas from different areas, and to develop new lines of research. BLAST provides an opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to learn about new developments in several related areas of the foundations of mathematics, to interact with leading national and international researchers, and to showcase their own work. This grant will support the participation of speakers, graduate students, and recent Ph.D. recipients in the three 2022-2024 meetings. Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is actively sought and encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe conference website is https://math.colorado.edu/blast/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
