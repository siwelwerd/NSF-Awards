 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and the Biological Anthropology program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Scott Maddux at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist studying nasal morphology. Humans inhabit diverse environments, ranging from tropical rainforests to Arctic tundra. The varying climatic conditions of these environments place different levels of stress on the upper respiratory tract, which must ensure that inspired air is sufficiently warmed and humidified to avoid damaging the lungs.  As the nose is where most heat and moisture is transferred to air during each breath, differences in nasal size and shape around the globe have been argued to reflect climatic pressures on nasal function. However, such relationships between nasal anatomy and climatic pressures have not been rigorously tested. Accordingly, this project will investigate associations between nasal form and climate in a large sample of living humans using anatomical data collected from computed tomography (CT) scans, computer modeling of nasal airflow patterns, and internal nasal air temperature/humidity values collected in a climate chamber. This will thus be the first to directly test whether variation in nasal anatomy and function follow climatic expectations, shedding light on both our evolutionary past and future adaptive scenarios.\r\n\r\nVariation in nasal form is believed to be adaptive based on a strong statistical association between nasal morphology and particular climates. However, no studies have empirically linked differences in anatomical structure to different physiological outcomes. Further, a recent analytical shift to Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis, used to assess moisture and heat transfer within the nasal passage in silico, has not been validated using in vivo measurements.  This project will test key nasal ecogeographic hypotheses of nasal form and function using a large diverse sample of living participants ranging in age from 18-35 years old. Variation in nasal anatomy will be assessed using cranial CT scans and paired in vivo intranasal air temperature/humidity values collected with a nasal probe in a climate chamber under four different climatic conditions (at room-temperature, cold/dry, hot/dry, and hot/humid). CT scan data will then be used to perform CFD modeling of nasal physiology which will then be compared to in vivo data to validate CFD results. This project will advance our understanding of human variation, evolutionary adaptations to environment, provide insight into nasal morphologies more susceptible to respiratory issues in particular climate conditions, and potential insight into how nasal form may change in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n          Through this NSF SPRF, the PI, Dr. Elizabeth Cho, gained invaluable professional training and extensive experience working with live participants as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC).  The primary objective of her project was to test whether variation in nasal morphology could be linked to differences in physiological function in extreme environments.  Additionally, measurements of intranasal temperature and humidity obtained from an intranasal probe were to be compared against the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to assess the interchangeability of in vivo and in silico models.  Following any necessary adjustments, CFD analyses would be used to evaluate the dynamics of airflow within the nasal passage of participants based off models rendered from participant computerized tomography (CT) scans.  As this project was an integral part of a larger collaborative project, which seeks to establish whether anatomical variation in body form impacts thermoregulation in different climatic conditions, Dr. Cho screened individuals interested in participating in the study and (for those that went on to become participants) collected the following types of data: a qualitative health survey, anthropometric and skin fold thickness measurements, bone density and body composition (acquired through DEXA scans), and full-body CT scans.  Repeated measures of blood pressure, core body temperature, skin temperature, resting metabolic rate, water loss, respiratory rate, and the temperature and relative humidity (RH) of air within and entering/exiting the nasal passage were gathered inside a climate chamber set to room temperature (22&deg;C, 50% RH), cold-dry conditions (5&deg;C, 80% RH), hot-dry conditions (44&deg;C, 15% RH), and hot-humid conditions (38&deg;C, 85% RH) with at least 24 hours between a participant\u2019s climate exposures.\n\n          This project allowed the PI to mentor and collaborate with two doctoral students, four undergraduate students, as well as a medical student and resulted in four conference presentations.  One presentation evaluated nasal projection and aspects of the nasal aperture in a global osteological sample using linear measurements and shape analysis.  While nasal height and breadth were found to correlate with climate, nasal bridge elevation and angulation was not associated with climate.  This suggests nasal projection is not a universal adaptation to cold-dry environments, despite its traditional association with higher latitudes.  A second presentation looked at airflow in the nasal passage throughout the nasal cycle while a third examined the nose\u2019s ability to condition air effectively in different climates.  Using models of human nasal passages created from CT scans and CFD analysis, the nose\u2019s capacity to condition air was found to be stable across the nasal cycle despite differences in levels of mucosal congestion.  Furthermore, levels of heat and moisture transferred to inspired air for tall, narrow noses and short, broad noses were consistent with those proposed by thermoregulatory theories.  The last presentation explored aspects of nasal variation that could potentially impact an individual\u2019s air conditioning capabilities (deviated septum, paradoxical turbinates, and conchae bullosa) and compared levels of prevalence between large, diverse samples of asthmatics and non-asthmatics.  A statistically higher incidence of conchae bullosa and concha bullosa paired with a paradoxical turbinate were found in asthmatics, and could have clinical implications.  Three manuscripts are nearing completion and will be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals in the near future.\n\n          Lastly, while most ecogeographic research has limited its focus to the assessment of morphological variation in males, this project has roughly equal male and female sample sizes.  This will increase female representation in ecogeographic research, allow for a better understanding of how different climate conditions affect both sexes, and can increase the health and safety of all humans residing in extreme environments.  It will also facilitate a more accurate evaluation of adaptation in the human fossil record.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth C Cho"
