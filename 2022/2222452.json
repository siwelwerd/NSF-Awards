 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the United States becomes more diverse, the opportunities for interracial interactions \u2014 contact between people from different racial and ethnic groups \u2014 has subsequently increased. Positive interracial contact is associated with many societal benefits including reductions in prejudice and discrimination. Extensive work demonstrates, however, that interracial, compared to same-race, interactions are stressful, in part, because they increase the likelihood of experiencing social identity threat \u2014 being devalued based on one\u2019s social group membership. Recent research suggests that people\u2019s experiences during interracial interactions are further shaped by the gender of one\u2019s interaction partner. To have a more complete understanding of interracial interactions and to develop interventions that foster positive interracial interactions, it is important to understand how gender and racial/ethnic background together shape people\u2019s experiences in these interactions. This project forwards and evaluates a novel, theoretically based model of the effects of cross-gender interracial interactions on people\u2019s experiences in these interactions. To move us closer to a potential intervention, we also examine whether the specific types of goals that people bring into an interracial interaction influences participants\u2019 interaction experiences.\r\n \r\nThis project uses an experimental approach to examine the effects of cross-gender interracial interactions on people\u2019s affect, cognition, and behavior. In particular, we will test whether participants\u2019 gender and race/ethnicity in addition to an interaction partner\u2019s gender and race/ethnicity together shape people\u2019s experiences in these interactions. The research also investigates whether an interaction partner's goals for the interaction (learning or performance goals) influences people\u2019s interaction experiences. It is hypothesized that people will report more negative experiences in cross-gender relative to gender-matched interracial interactions; however, people\u2019s negative interaction experiences will be attenuated when their partner adopts a learning goal prior to the interaction. This research is poised to offer novel insights about how to promote comfortable and rewarding experiences in all interracial interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
