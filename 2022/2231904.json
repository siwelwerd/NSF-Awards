 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a technology that has potential applications in integrated circuits for the internet of things (IoT) as well as for military use. The applictions seeks to enable the design of a full radiofrequency transceiver (or components) that can be tuned across a wide frequency range  to meet multiple wireless standards with a single reconfigurable design. This transceiver has the potential to reduce costs and increase markets. The proposed commercialization effort represents an opportunity to increase the reach of wireless technologies broadly while bolstering US growth in this crucial area.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a widely tunable and reconfigurable \u201con-chip\u201d radio integrated circuit. The innovation that makes this possible is a novel tunable resonant element that can be fabricated on-chip.  Wideband radio components that can accommodate a range of carrier frequencies do not enable high performance since they sacrifice gain, sensitivity, linearity, noise, and power efficiency to achieve functionality. Existing tunable narrowband solutions make similar tradeoffs due to the lack of a tunable inductive element that can be easily and cheaply integrated into a commercial process. The proposed technology may be used to construct tunable amplifiers, oscillators, and other basic analog components that are used in commercial radios. This team proposes to explore the market for reconfigurable radio frequency integrated circuits while developing a prototype system demonstrator for a full transceiver.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Existing tunable narrowband solutions make similar tradeoffs due to the lack of a tunable inductive element that can be easily and cheaply integrated into a commercial CMOS or IC process.\n\n\nOur original hypothesis about a proposed product was an IP block that could be configured to meet a range of standards including WiFi standards at multiple frequencies and data rates as well as Bluetooth standards. This would enable a single design to meet many different end-users needs and enable future proofing of the wireless interfaces for chips at the time of fabrication.\n\n\nOur target market included 3 primary groups:\n\n\n1) wireless IP developers who sell IPs to IC designers such as IoT system designers\n\n\n2) Wireless system product/marketing managers and\n\n\n3) researchers/developers who need software defined radios (ie. Military contractors, product developers) \n\n\nWith this in mind, we began our I-Corps journey. Our I-Corps team consisted of three members, each offering unique expertise as recognized leaders in technology research, development, and commercialization. The team worked together extensively to arrange and conduct over 100 interviews across a wide range of potential customers, partners, and competators in the space of flexible and software defined radio (SFDR).\n\n\nThe primary outcome of this project was a much greater understanding of the product and customer space, a partially filled out business model canvas that can be used to develop a full business model, and a wide range of connections to partners and customers. The big \"take away\" from this experience was an understanding that the largest and highest volume market is not always the right one, and that by talking to these various customers, we can ultimately find the best first approach to a viable product. Our original hypothesis that favored the high volume market in IoT, looked significantly less favorable after conducting interviews and realizing both that the minimum viable product in this space was larger than what we wanted as an initial product and that this group mostly cared about cost and ease of use rather than performance. This shifted out primary focus to number 3, users of SFDR in the defence space.
