 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2022 MVAPICH User group (MUG) Conference will be a venue for bringing together leading experts, including users, system administrators, researchers, engineers, and students, to discuss and share their knowledge on using the MVAPICH2 libraries to discuss and share their knowledge on using the MVAPICH2 libraries. The event will include a set of talks from researchers, users, and system administrators who are experts in the field. The event also includes contributed presentations (submitted through an open call for presentation and selected by the MVAPICH team) and presentations from the MVAPICH team on tuning and optimization strategies for various library components, troubleshooting guidelines, etc.  The conference, to be held in Columbus, OH, from August 22-24, 2022, is organized by a leading group of experts in message passing (MPI) and networking technologies.  The project will fund students to participate in the conference, to engage deeply with the MVAPICH research and user community.  The project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of scholars.\r\n\r\nThe conference organizers are recruiting students wishing to participate in the program from a diverse set of institutions, and with the goal of a diverse set of participants. Prospective participants will have to submit an application, and submissions are evaluated by a committee for scientific merit and to promote diversity.  The students will get several benefits from attending the conference: (1) exposure to the latest high performance computing (HPC) technologies (computing platforms, accelerators, and networks), their features, and their impact on designing HPC software environments; (2) in-depth exposure to the challenges and techniques in designing, developing and maintaining open-source software environments for HPC systems; (3) training on systematic tuning and optimization of HPC software stacks; and (4) interaction with national laboratory and industry professionals.  The funding provided by NSF will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of researchers in HPC, networking, and message passing technologies, while encouraging diversity in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
