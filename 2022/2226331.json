The team will design and assemble a prototypical biological device for the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology. The development and production of this device will provide undergraduate students with hands-on training in a variety of scientific areas, including synthetic biology, molecular biology and computational modeling. Broadening participation in STEM research is an important goal of this project. \r\n\r\nThis project supports the interdisciplinary research training of a diverse team of undergraduate students at the University of Virginia. The team will design and produce a prototypical biological device for the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology. The participants will receive training in a variety of STEM disciplines, acquire a global perspective on innovation and strategic road mapping, and have many opportunities to network with leaders in STEM fields such as synthetic biology, molecular biology and computational modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
