 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  Professors Aaron Timperman from the University of Illinois and Boyd Edwards from Utah State University are investigating the fundamental mechanisms of a new separation method called microfluidic traveling-wave electrophoresis (TWE). TWE is a promising method for reducing the complexity of samples that may come from biological organisms or the environment. In the investigation of the mechanisms of TWE, the team is determining precisely how TWE works and on optimizing its performance. The unique characteristics of TWE separations make it well-suited for applications that cannot be achieved with other separation methods. The TWE separation is driven with very low voltages (+/-0.5 V) which are 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller than its nearest relative, microchannel electrophoresis. This low voltage requirement makes TWE highly compatible with fieldable sensing systems. TWE should prove helpful in applications such as detection of biomarkers in human medical, forensic, and drug testing, detection of toxic substances in the environment, and detection of threat agents for homeland defense. The team collaborates with the Illinois Academic Ambassadors to enhance exposure of middle school and high school students to STEM research.\r\n\r\nA combined experimental and theoretical modeling approach is used to provide a thorough and quantitative description of the mechanisms of TWE. TWE is distinct as a low frequency AC electrophoretic separation in which a longitudinal electric field wave propagates through the microfluidic channel. The separation mechanisms of TWE are unique: TWE can rapidly switch between separative transport, non-separative transport, and immobilization simply by changing the frequency of the traveling wave; and both anions and cations move in the same direction. The goal of this work is to fully understand and quantitatively describe the fundamental mechanisms of traveling wave electrophoresis. The objectives are: 1) determining the mechanisms of zone migration, 2) determining the mechanisms of zone dispersion, and 3) defining the fundamental equations of separation efficiency, resolution, and peak capacity. The experimental results guide the development of the theoretical models, and the fundamental equations derived are experimentally verified. These fundamental equations provide a basis with which this separation method can be quantitatively compared with others and inform optimal device design. The experimental team includes both undergraduate and graduate students. This is an interdisciplinary project that exposes students to separations, theoretical modeling, and fabrication in Engineering. An outreach component is included that impacts middle and high school students, exposing them to STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For inclusion in a portable system for the separation of charge molecules and particles in solution, TWE has the distinct advantage of having a very low voltage requirement, requiring just +/- 0.5V, that can be easily supplied by a mobile phone. &nbsp;Our previous experimental results demonstrated that TWE was capable of high efficiency separations but required low frequencies (~1Hz) for the ~25 mm electrode spacing used.&nbsp; Ion migration at this low frequency, ~1 Hz, in TWE raised questions in the minds of electrochemists who, relying on equations for the calculation of charging timescales in typical electrochemical cells, wondered how ions could migrate over such long timescales and at such low voltages.&nbsp; Thus, our primary goal became to resolve this apparent discrepancy. We first performed experimental measurements to look for the presence of charge transfer reactions, which was thought to be unlikely because +/- 0.5 V is below the water electrolysis threshold. Experimentally, we determined the voltage required for bubble formation and performed a current-voltage study. This current voltage study revealed not charge transfer reaction for applied potential of &le; 1.25 V, but at 1.5 V bubble formation, which is indicative of charge transfer was observed. Thus, no evidence was found for measurable Faradaic current &le; 1.25 V, which is consistent with electrochemical theory. However, to avoid erroneous conclusions due to resistance and capacitance within the electronic system, we devised a new method to probe the electric field within the microchannel. We call this new system that optically tracks the motion particles within the microchannel, transverse alternating current electrophoresis (TrACE) shown in Fig. 1. TrACE provides a new method to measure the electrophoretic mobility and size of particles from mammalian cells to viruses in size. Although the wave can have any shape in TrACE, we focused on square waves because they are like a concatenated series of DC segments. An experimentally recorded trajectory of a microparticle driven by a transverse square electric field wave is shown in Fig. 2. A basic theoretical model replicated the frequency and phase dependence of the particle trajectories well, but an anomaly was observed in the amplitude that increased with decreasing frequency. To improve the model, we developed a one-dimensional finite element analysis model that included time dependent DC electrophoresis and charging current in the absence of charge transfer reactions. &nbsp;This model reveals that ion migration does occur at slow speeds in TWE and predicts particle motion that is similar to our experimental observations in TrACE. Thus, the model confirms that the same physical forces present in DC electrophoresis also drive migration in TrACE while the observed motion does not require charge transfer. The predictions of the model were further verified by imaging the motion of positively (rhodamine 6G) and negatively (fluorescein) charged dyes in the TrACE system (Fig. 3), which qualitatively agree well with the model.</p>\n<p>The microfluidic transverse AC electrophoresis system (TrACE) is much easier to fabricate (Fig. 1) and allows charged particles to precisely probe the dynamics of the local electric field. Like TWE, TrACE uses low frequency AC electrophoresis, but uses optical particle tracking velocimetry to precisely measure the electric field dynamics within the center of the microchannel. No phase lag is observed in TrACE, meaning that particle acceleration is fast, which is consistent with the basic predictions that acceleration should be on the order of 10 ns. Also, electroosmotic flow (EOF) in the transverse direction was shown to be negligible at frequencies &ge; 20 Hz. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, this model and experimental observations verify that ion and particle migration are much slower than predicted by standard estimates of double layer charging time. This charging time is much slower than the predicted standard charging time constant because the system has 1) opposite concentration polarization before each half-period of the square wave, the 2) low ionic concentration contributes to largely depleting the electroneutral layer (ENL) of ions, 3) as the diffuse layer develops the electric field is screened within the ENL, and 4) the long distances the ions must travel (many ions will travel from one electrode to the next rather than from 10s of nm from the bulk to the electrode. Simply stated, the electric field wave continually drives ions to the opposite side of the microchannel, and forces most of the ions to move much greater distances than in a standard electrochemical cell. Physically, the TrACE and TWE systems are different from standard electrochemical cells because the working and counter electrodes are unusually close, the electrolyte concentration is low, the electrode surface area to solution volume is high, and the ionic concentration is low.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Aaron&nbsp;T&nbsp;Timperman</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2216766/2216766_10543525_1720046825043_Fl_R6G_in_TrACE--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2216766/2216766_10543525_1720046825043_Fl_R6G_in_TrACE--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig. 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2216766/2216766_10543525_1720046825043_Fl_R6G_in_TrACE--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig. 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Negatively charged fluroscein and positively charged rhodamine are observed to migrate to opposite electrodes in TrACE.
