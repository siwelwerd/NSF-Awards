 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic electronic materials use brilliant dye-like molecules and polymers in special applications such as high performance cellphone displays and flexible solar cells.  The development and application of new and improved organic electronic materials occupies the attention of a large community of international researchers.  This community also seeks to adapt their insights to hybrid lead halide perovskite materials and future applications like bioelectronics and neuromorphic computing.  They come together once every two years to share their accomplishments at the International Symposium on Functional Pi Electron Systems.  The 15th incarnation of this symposium series (FPi15) will be held in the summer of 2023 in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The venue is an excellent opportunity for graduate student researchers to network within the international community.  This funding provides travel support for diverse graduate student participation in the FPi15 symposium and thus promotes a vibrant and inclusive future for the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThis project funded 10 travel stipends to support student participation in the 15th International Symposium on Functional Pi Electron Systems held June 17-21, 2023 in Raleigh North Carolina. This is a major international event that brings together several hundred researchers from all over the world to present and discuss the most recent work in the fields of organic optoelectronic materials and devices. It is crucial that young scientists are integrated into this vibrant community both for their own career development and the future of the field itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nStipend recipients each received $1000 to defray substantial travel expenses associated with Symposium participation. The recipients were mostly graduate students and one undergraduate student. They hailed from locations across the United State, Canada, and the United Kingdom.  The value of supporting their participation in the Symposium is best expressed by a quote from one of the stipend recipients: \"I will be attendingto present work done by my senior colleagues and its continuation, which is the subject of my doctoral degree. I hope to not only connect my laboratorys research with other institutions, but also develop links between other scholars and myself so that I may continue my research beyond my studies.\" This highlights the excellent networking and professional development opportunities available in the symposium that are of particular value to early career scientists and engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stipends also helped to broaden participation among underrepresented groups in the field which is particularly male-dominated. The stipend recipients included 7 women, one non-binary person, and two men. In addition multiple races and nationalities were represented, including an American Indian, and an immigrant to the U.S. from South Sudan. The Symposium included a dedicated panel of well-established scientists from diverse backgrounds who spoke about their different and often difficult paths to success in the field. This was an important event aimed at building the type of welcoming and inclusive community that many of the stipend recipients expressed enthusiasm for in their written applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielBDougherty\n"
