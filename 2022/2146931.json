 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to provide a safe, wearable device to to improve the quality of sleep. Sleep deprivation due to insomnia or other factors represents a significant health risk linked to various daily issues and later disorders in life. The lack of sleep costs the United States an estimated $411 billion in lost productivity and wages. This novel medical technology will provide an externally worn system which delivers a combination of low risk and reversible visual and auditory impulses, enabling patients to experience brainwaves associated with the desired restorative sleep stage. The product aims to capture a significant portion of the annual $80B global sleep aid market predominantly comprised of supplements and drugs. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will complete prototype engineering for a patient worn system which provides sensory stimulation in order to modulate brain waveforms during sleep. The system utilizes controlled and safe light and sound stimuli to transpose the brainwaves associated with the desired sleeping state into the recipient\u2019s brain measured using non invasive electrical activity (EEG). The system is based on peer-reviewed evidence that normal brain wave patterns can be effectively transposed to a subject suffering from sleep disorders for restoring normative sleep. The phase I project will complete the data analysis of reference patient sleep patterns, and prototype design engineering to enable pilot studies and gaining evidence in subsequent stages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
