 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a technology to combat indoor air pollution as one of the risk factors for premature death. According to Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the World Heath Organization, poor indoor air quality is responsible for 1.6-4.3  million deaths yearly. According to the EPA, Americans, on average, spend 90% of their time indoors, where the concentrations of some pollutants are often 2 -5 times higher than outdoors. Opening windows and increasing air exchange rates can significantly improve Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and can also reduce the risk of COVID exposure. In the current market, window that can automatically open/close and/or pump air into or out of a room to improve the IAQ are not available. The proposed technology is an automated solution that can bring fresh air inside in to improve IAQ. The technology may also work with other smart home systems to share and store IAQ data for scientific research, pattern recognition, and forecasting, potentially triggering new discoveries. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology that can provide improved indoor air quality. The technology can automatically detect poor indoor air quality and can initiate an air exchange to lower pollution levels. The device is portable, plug and play, easy to install (does not require any modifications of existing windows), low energy (run by solar power/phone charger), and made from flexible responsive polymer actuators that pumps air in/out. The window is available in different sizes and shapes to fit conventional spaces and can also be custom made for specific purposes. The window is programmed to automatically respond to changes in temperature, humidity, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other gases, and can be integrated with popular home automation systems and platforms. The technology may help to ensure healthy indoor air quality using an automatic indoor-outdoor air exchange.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, since the mass introduction of sealed HVAC systems in our buildings, the purpose of a window has become confined merely to looking outside, let alone bringing in fresh air, comfortable temperature, pleasing morning moisture, the smell of the Jasmine, or the sparrow chirps. Window connects us with nature for physical and mental well-being and is necessary to maintain good Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). If we only consider the importance of IAQ, we might need to reopen our windows. Currently, EPA ranks indoor air pollution as one of the top five environmental risks to public health [1]. Nevertheless, most conventional heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air [2]. On the other hand, the windows in our buildings and homes must be designed and intelligent enough to bring fresh air in automatically 24/7 when needed, without human intervention. Also, it is not possible for the user to open and close windows repeatedly for indoor air exchange day and night, even when the outdoor temperature is within comfort level. Healthy indoor air is essential for physical and mental health and maximum human performance. Poor indoor air quality is a silent killer, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when most people spent nearly all day indoors. According to the EPA, Americans, on average, spend approximately 90% of their time indoors [3]. In response to these issues, this research focuses on developing a Smart Breathing Window (SBW) that automatically detects indoor-outdoor air quality and conditions and initiates an air exchange to maintain healthy indoor air quality 24/7. This research utilizes electro-active polymer to attain energy efficiency and design flexibility. It is portable, plug &amp; play, easy to install (no need to change existing windows), low energy&nbsp; and made of responsive polymer actuators which gives the liberty of making it with different sizes and shapes. A prototype has been developed to assess the performance, and the data has been monitored thoroughly. The result shows that this prototype is approximately 300% more efficient in improving IAQ (using CO2 as the variable) compared to the same open window aperture for natural ventilation. It also shows it can reduce 15%-35% of HVAC load (context-sensitive) by utilizing comfortable outdoor air temperature. This research shows promising results and calls for more investigation and cross-disciplinary collaboration. &ldquo;Smart Breathing Window&rdquo; also can work in sync with any smart home systems, and can share and store IAQ data in the cloud which will be used for scientific research, recognizing patterns, and forecasting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>[1] Indoor air quality backgrounder: The basics - U.S. environmental ...
