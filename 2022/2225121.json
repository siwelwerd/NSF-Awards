 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whistler-mode \"chorus\" waves are naturally occurring radio emissions in Earth's outer radiation belt. These waves can resonantly interact with trapped energetic electrons (~10 keV to >1 MeV), both accelerating them to high speeds and scattering them into the atmosphere as \"particle precipitation.\" Intense chorus waves, propagating at oblique angles to the background magnetic field, invoke such resonances in multiple harmonics and produce strong electron responses on rapid timescales, within tens of seconds. However, the role of different resonance harmonics in shaping the global state of the radiation belt remains unknown. This investigation will study the interactions between electrons and these intense oblique chorus waves to address this problem. Understanding the properties and mechanisms of these processes is important for forecasting space weather and its effects on sensitive systems, such as spacecraft surfaces and electronics. This project will also support early-career scientists and a graduate student, and the findings will be incorporated into public outreach materials and undergraduate classes at the University of Texas at Dallas.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to address three specific scientific questions: 1) How does energetic electron phase space density evolve under nonlinear wave-particle interactions with oblique whistler-mode chorus waves? 2) Are there observable distinctions between different electron harmonic resonances with magnetospheric chorus waves and, if so, what are they? 3) What are the respective roles of Landau and cyclotron resonances in shaping the outer radiation belt in events with intense oblique chorus waves? To answer these questions, the investigators will develop numerical models of both oblique chorus wave packets and electron phase space density evolution, and quantitatively compare model results with in-situ measurements made by NASA's Van Allen Probes. Importantly, this research may lead to the discovery of direct observational evidence of electron nonlinear resonances in distinctive harmonics, including Landau resonance. These important processes have been theorized to occur in outer space but have yet to be confirmed with experimental evidence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
