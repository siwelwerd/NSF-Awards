 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, with member programs at 45 universities in 16 states in the region. This grant provides support for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the 57th annual SRCOS Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics, held in Jekyll Island, Georgia on October 2-5, 2022. The purpose of the conference is to encourage interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics and to provide motivation and direction to further research progress. The SRC is particularly valuable for graduate students, undergraduate students, isolated statisticians, and faculty from smaller regional schools in the southern region within driving distance. The meeting provides an opportunity for young researchers to interact closely with leaders in the field in a manner not possible at larger meetings.\r\n\r\nSpeakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups. Under the travel support provided by this award, graduate students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers. In addition, the meeting will also include the annual Statistical Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), a conference within a conference aimed to encourage the participation of undergraduate students from under-represented groups to pursue graduate education and career opportunities in STEM fields. SURE will include events specifically for undergraduate students and undergraduate mentors, such as a panel about career opportunities in statistics, a \u201cReal Data Analytics Workshop,\u201d and a speed-mentoring session with current statistics and biostatistics graduate students. This award will support SURE, encouraging under-represented students to enter STEM fields and providing training to support this endeavor. More information about the conference can be found at the website: https://www.srcos.org/conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
