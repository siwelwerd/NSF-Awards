 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron is an essential element for life and plays an important role in defining how much atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up into the ocean by phytoplankton. However, iron cycling is closely governed by the chemistry of seawater; nearly all iron in seawater is associated with various unknown organic compounds, called iron-binding ligands, which impact whether and how iron is utilized by organisms and the distribution of iron throughout the ocean. Detail understanding of the cycling of organic iron-binding ligands is necessary to understand iron cycling in the oceans and the connections between iron cycling and atmospheric carbon. The proposed research will be carried out as a part of US GEOTRACES expedition to test the hypothesis that the Southern Ocean is a globally significant source of iron-binding organic ligands, and that different sources of these organic molecules lead to different iron-ligand characteristics. The US GEOTRACES program is a large collaborative effort to sample ocean systems at high resolution for a suite of key trace elements and isotopes. The South Pacific and Southern Ocean regions targeted by the upcoming US GEOTRACES GP17 cruises are important locations of water mass formation and the subsequent transport of carbon and nutrients to the global ocean. Organic ligands produced in these regions thus have important implications for the stabilization, reactivity, and residence time of iron along the path of global water mass circulation and could impact the global oceanic inventory of dissolved iron. \r\n\r\nThis project will measure the distribution of iron-binding organic ligands, and identify specific organic molecules that comprise these ligands, in field and experimental samples collected on upcoming US GEOTRACES cruises in the South Pacific (GP17-OCE) and Southern Ocean (GP17-ANT). These datasets will be utilized to conduct the first extensive intercalibration of the two most widely used approaches for characterizing iron-binding organic ligands, providing important insight into these datasets and how they can be synthesized to improve understanding of iron cycling in the oceans. All data from this project will be made publicly available. Project activities will provide educational and training opportunities for middle school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and results will be shared with the public through the development of virtual reality modules and via local outreach events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
