 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports the attendance of 50 US-based students to attend the eighth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 22) which will be held in Haifa, Israel, in August 2022. The federated logic conference is a large event which brings together nine major international conferences in the area of Formal Methods, and around 80 satellite workshops. While the participating conferences are normally held individually by their local conference organization on an annual basis, they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every four years.\r\n\r\nEnhancing the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems is widely accepted as one the grand challenges facing the computing-research community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal Methods. Attending a large international conference with such diverse topical themes within this domain is a formative experience for graduate students, enabling them to build international collaborative relationships early in their research careers. Attending FLoC helps ensure that future generations of US scientists and engineers gain professional international research experiences early in their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
