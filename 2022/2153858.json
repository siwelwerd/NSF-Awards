 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industrial risk management deals with quality degradation, contingency, faults, and accidents of industrial systems that bear immediate, severe, and potentially catastrophic consequences on property, personnel, communities, and the environment. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) Advanced Studies Institute (ASI) will train U.S. students to be well-prepared professionals in the field of industrial risk management to improve reliability and efficiency of industrial systems. This ASI\u2019s trainees will become ambassadors to promote the critical importance of risk management, reliability, resilience, and safety of industrial systems. Additionally, this project will train highly skilled professionals with international vision and experience in this field. Through strategic outreach and recruitment, this project will further broaden opportunities and enable the participation of under-represented minorities and female students in STEM fields. Students will develop global views in their research to be conscious and innovative on advanced technology, environment, and international collaboration. The ASI will be hosted in France by a university plus a research institution noted for their work in industrial risk management, ensuring that students are immersed in a diverse and vibrant learning and research environment. This ASI will recruit 14 U.S. graduate students (28 total in two years) and provide a comprehensive two-week training program with short courses, hands-on experience, industry engagement, and international collaboration to engage students in active learning and research at the frontiers of industrial risk management.  \r\n\r\nThe theme of this ASI is industrial risk management with focus on advanced methodologies for active diagnosis, accurate characterization, and reliable mitigation of various industrial risks and their applications to renewable energy systems, smart grids, and autonomous systems. The institute is hosted in INSA CVL at Bourges which is an excellent French university and INRIA Lille that is a French national research institution. The topics covered in the ASI include: Active Diagnosis of Industrial Risks in the Form of Faults/Failures in Industrial Systems, Active Risk Diagnosis using Non-asymptotic Algebraic Methods, Risk Characterization in terms of Detectability in Discrete Event Systems, Analysis of Nonlinear Systems for Risk Characterization with Robotic Applications, Information-Based Risk Assessment and Mitigation of Network Systems with Applications to Renewable Energy, Reliable Mitigation of Autonomous Quad Rotors, and Risk Analysis and Mitigation Design of Homogeneous Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
