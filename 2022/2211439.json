 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Feminist Geography Conference: Pushing Scientific Boundaries seeks to engage scholars from Geography and related disciplines in a series of paper and panel sessions, and workshops to meet multiple objectives. First, the conference provides mentorship and networking opportunities for Black Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) and international scholars in the subdiscipline of human geography. Second, the conference furthers geographic science through robust exchanges among scholars, along with presentations and workshops that highlight key contributions to geography and discuss different methodological practices. These objectives are integrated into several conference format innovations that generate new kinds of collaborations and participation. These innovations include holding a hybrid-virtual conference in multiple sites, hosting a flipped conference model with archives, hosting virtual keynote panel discussions, and developing value-added in-person conference activities. These formats enhance accessibility for early-career researchers, graduate students, international scientists, and members of historically excluded groups in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nSociety benefits from the inclusion of multiple, even conflicting, perspectives. The knowledge generated from different perspectives has the capacity to enhance geographic science, which in turn enhances and improves research and outreach work with the public. The conference provides a vital space for mentoring and networking across national boundaries and allow international students and scholars the opportunity to benefit from a professional space that has been inaccessible due to financial or travel restrictions, building capacity for geographic research through the support and retention of graduate students and early-career scholars from underrepresented backgrounds. The sharing of pedagogical innovation expands beyond the conference to classrooms throughout the United States and internationally. Additionally, the products from this conference will remain widely available through the conference's website and dissemination on social media platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
