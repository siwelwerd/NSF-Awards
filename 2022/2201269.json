 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many smaller and mid-sized campuses in Pennsylvania have compelling science research and education activities along with an awareness of the benefits associated with better access to cyberinfrastructure resources. Yet, these under-resourced schools continue to struggle through the process to: identify, understand, and quantify their existing science drivers; understand the corresponding cyberinfrastructure; and, then provide both the technical and application support associated with the cyberinfrastructure to support initial and future research applications. For some institutions, the standard regional connectivity model, a separate connection to a high-performance research and education network, may not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis project works with the initial set of pilot schools, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Lafayette College and Lehigh Carbon Community College to develop mechanisms for a campus to identify cyberinfrastructure-based applications, understand the required cyberinfrastructure-based resources and identify appropriate campus science DMZ architectures. The project investigates the feasibility of various campus and regional Science DMZ designs through outreach to existing funded projects and develop a design for a statewide regional science DMZ aimed at easing access to cyberinfrastructure resources in a cost-effective manner for small and mid-sized campuses in the region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis planning grant supported the efforts of a team from Lafayette College, Indiana University at Pennsylvania, Lehigh Carbon Community College and KINBER.  The team identified five key planning grant goals to set out and address:\nGoal #1: Identification and Support of Science and Education Drivers. Identify the process to identify, understand, and quantify existing science and education drivers; understand the corresponding cyberinfrastructure.  Provide both the technical and application support associated with the implementation of required cyberinfrastructure in support of the initial and then subsequent research and education applications.  The goal includes Identifying overlapping interest areas and commonly used cyberinfrastructure resources. \nGoal #2: Identification of Science and Education Drivers and bridging to the Technical Aspects: Develop mechanisms for a campus to identify cyberinfrastructure-based applications and understand the required cyberinfrastructure-based resources and appropriate campus science DMZ architectures including its relationship to the existing campus network.\nGoal #3: Technical Aspects: Investigate the feasibility of various campus and regional Science DMZ designs through outreach to existing funded projects.

Identify the various models.\nGoal #5: Regional Workshops. Convene a regional workshop that codifies and disseminates the information collected during the planning process and identifies next steps.\nNotable outcomes included:\n\n\nIncreased collaboration amongst project team members as well as outreach organization staff.  Improved relations amongst individuals from within the Pennsylvania region as well as regional and national individuals which has paved the way for future collaborative CI project initiatives and potential endeavors.\n\n\nInvestigations, collection of materials and sharing of knowledge surrounding the architecture and CI requirements for improved capabilities at smaller under resourced institutions.\n\n\nIdentification of resources for cyber professionals in the research and education communities of interest and communities.\n\n\nIn person and virtual participants are better equipped to identify Science and Educational drivers and tie to Cyber Infrastructure architectures, operational norms as well as sustainability approaches.\n\n\nParticipant exposure to NSF sponsored training, knowledge transfer opportunities and cyber infrastructure plan development fundamentals.\n\n\nBetter understanding of a number of novel approaches happening in the region to help address staffing sustainability.  \n\n\nIdentification of common challenges facing under resources institutions: Access to High Performance Computing Resources, Large Data Transfers of Research Data, Virtual Computer Labs, Remote access to on-campus scientific instrumentation, GenCyber camps and training programs, Federated Identity challenges, and overall IT Cyber Infrastructure resource constraints.\n\n\nExample CI Plans were identified and shared.\n\n\nBy way of the five goals, the results of the collective activity of the project have confirmed technical best practices and key components of the Science DMZ architecture and deployment model, even for the smaller under-resourced institutions.  The ESnet (Department of Energy's dedicated science network) model network architecture explicitly designed for high-performance applications, where the science network is distinct from the general-purpose network, uses dedicated systems for data transfer. Also includes systems for performance measurement and network testing as well as security policies and enforcement mechanisms that are tailored for high performance science environments have been  confirmed.  \nThe grant activity has also identified a common sustainability theme among collaborating participants.  Both fiscal and staffing support for CI projects was at times difficult to secure, especially at under-resourced institutions.  Sustaining knowledge and expertise was identified as important for long term success in the science and educational driven CI supported initiatives. The concepts of shared resources amongst Minority Server Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions (NASNTIs) and Minority serving institutions (MSIs) is gaining wider community support.  The team learned about the efforts being made by the Minority Serving-Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (MS-CC), and the efforts in the Community and Capacity Building, Workforce Development and  Research Support areas.  Specifically, the goals of creating a single unified DMZ for Collaborative Research for MS-CC Membership were of interest to the project team as well as the developmental evaluation, feedback surveys, and building internal facilitation capability energies.\n Significant Interest in the sustainability approaches were identified by other similar regional alliances.  Approaches and similar project materials have been shared with this team and a sense of collaboration was achieved.  This team's experience and supporting information may be valuable to other smaller and under-resourced institutions in the United States.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan V Flood"
