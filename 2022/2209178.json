 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atomic nucleus is much too small to be visible with the human eye; however, its properties and structure can be examined with methods developed at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory (UKAL). At UKAL, the team employs a particle accelerator to produce neutrons that are in turn used to create gamma rays, which are characteristic of the nuclei to be studied. From these gamma rays it is possible to develop an image of the nucleus and gain an understanding of how the neutrons and protons comprising the nucleus interact within it. In addition, students at all levels are provided with opportunities to participate in these studies. Program participants receive hands-on experience and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to our national energy, medical, and security needs.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of the research program at UKAL is to address timely questions in nuclear structure and outstanding problems in related areas of nuclear science. This broad-based research program includes selected studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to neutrinoless double-beta decay; nuclei undergoing shape transitions; nuclear shape coexistence. A unique advantage of the laboratory is the capability of producing high-quality, time-bunched mono-energetic fast neutrons for inelastic scattering experiments to investigate low-energy collective modes in nuclei. With the scattering reaction, it is possible to obtain information which is not accessible at other facilities. Experimental innovations in the laboratory include the development of capabilities for measuring lifetimes in heavy nuclei with the Doppler-shift attenuation method following the inelastic scattering of the fast neutrons. These advances have made it possible to address important questions and make meaningful contributions in nuclear structure physics and related areas. The team has also opened other areas of study and engaged in complementary experiments with collaborators at other nuclear accelerator laboratories. Education at all levels continues to be an emphasis in these laboratory activities, and research at a small accelerator laboratory permits the mentoring of young scientists daily.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
