 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThe Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry supports 10 students, mainly from local community colleges in the Los Angeles basin area and primarily from groups underrepresented in the sciences, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. The students will engage in a wide-range of guided independent research projects in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry, while also participating in professional development activities, including workshops on ethics and responsible research topics, and overcoming stereotype threat and imposter syndrome. Together, the research and professional development activities prepare and motivate students to matriculate into four-year degree programs and for future careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. \r\n\r\nThe student participants will conduct individualized research projects across a wide-range of chemistry and biochemistry topics, including exploring the molecular effects on the freezing point in hydrocarbon mixtures; studying the mechanisms of antifreeze proteins; examining structural and morphological effects of nanoparticles; and employing computer simulations to understand the vibrational properties of weakly bound molecules. Along with the research, the students will participate in a weekly series of professional development workshops and social activities aimed at preparing them for future careers in chemistry and biochemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
