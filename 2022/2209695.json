 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increases in temperatures and drought duration and intensity due to climate change, together with the expansion of wildlife-urban interfaces, has dramatically increased the frequency and intensity of forest fires, and has had devastating effects on lives, property, and the environment. To address this challenge, this project\u2019s goal is to design a network of airborne drones and wireless sensors that can aid in initial wildfire localization and mapping, near-term prediction of fire progression, and providing communications support for firefighting personnel on the ground. Two key aspects differentiate the system from prior work: (1) It leverages and subsequently updates detailed three-dimensional models of the environment, including the effects of fuel type and moisture state, terrain, and atmospheric/wind conditions, in order to provide the most timely and accurate predictions of fire behavior possible, and (2) It adapts to hazardous and rapidly changing conditions, optimally balancing the need for wide-area coverage and maintaining communication links with personnel in remote locations. The science and engineering developed under this project can be adapted to many applications beyond wildfires including structural fires in urban and suburban settings, natural or man-made emergencies involving radiation or airborne chemical leaks, \"dirty bombs\" that release chemical or biological agents, or tracking highly localized atmospheric conditions surrounding imminent or on-going extreme weather events.\r\n\r\nThe system developed under this project will enable more rapid localization and situational awareness of wildfires at their earliest stages, better predictions of both local, near-term and event-scale behavior, better situational awareness and coordination of personnel and resources, and increased safety for fire fighters on the ground. Models ranging from simple algebraic relationships based on wind velocity to more complex time-dependent coupled fluid dynamics-fire physics models will be used to anticipate fire behavior. These models are hampered by stochastic processes such as the lofting of burning embers to ignite new fires, that cause errors to grow rapidly with time. This project is focused on closing the loop using sensor data provided by airborne drones and ground-based sensors (GBS). The models inform the sensing by anticipating rapid growth of problematic phenomena, and the subsequent sensing updates the models, providing local wind and spot fire locations. Closing this loop as quickly as possible is critical to mitigating the fire\u2019s impact. The system we propose integrates advanced fire modeling tools with mobile drones, wireless GBS, and high-level human interaction for both the initial attack of a wildfire event and subsequent on-going support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
