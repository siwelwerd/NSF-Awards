 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual opinions about controversial topics vary widely and do not always match the policies and laws that govern the issue. How do critical moments that define policies and laws affect individuals' attitudes? Do moments of institutional change cause more extreme attitudes? Do moments that reinforce the status quo lead to more entrenched attitudes? How do these moments affect people differently depending on the specific attitudes they hold? The current project examines changes in U.S. Americans' gender attitudes following a highly anticipated Supreme Court case on reproductive health that has direct implications for state laws. \r\n\r\nThis research involves well-controlled, naturalistic studies that are informed by psychological theories of attitude change and political science research on the link between policy and public opinion. Two studies, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal, assess gender attitudes before and after an impending Supreme Court decision on reproductive health. The studies also account for geographic variations in policy implementation. Additionally, this project examines specific conditions and mechanisms that influence attitudinal response to changes in state laws and policies. Gender attitudes of respondents may be affected by: (1) the perceived legitimacy of state and federal policy-making bodies, (2) the gender norms that they perceive among others in general and others close to them, (3) their pre-existing support for reproductive rights policy, and (4) their belief that reproductive rights policy is a gender-relevant issue. Understanding how policies influence opinions \u2013 pinpointing the specific causal mechanisms that transcend whether a person favors or opposes a policy change \u2013 provides insight into the relationship between institutions and individuals in a democratic society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
