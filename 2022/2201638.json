 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a practical and generalizable technology for manufacturing carbon products from polyolefins and their waste. While polyolefins represent the most widely produced and used category of polymers, they also contribute to the majority of plastic waste that imposes serious risks to the sustainable development of the environment and society. Current waste management strategies associated with polyolefins include landfilling, incineration, and conversion to products with less value. This project will focus on commercializing a simple, scalable process to provide an efficient solution for plastic upcycling. The associated technology may significantly increase the value of polyolefin waste through converting them to functional carbon products. These carbons may be used as additives for conventional plastic manufacturing as property modifiers and enhancers. In addition, remediating plastic pollution represents a strong societal demand, exemplified by explosive growth in the corresponding recycling industry. Also, this project provides great opportunities to stimulate plastic recycling and upcycling infrastructure in the surrounding regions, promoting local economic development of the corresponding industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform for upcycling polyolefin-derived plastic waste into functional, value-added carbon materials. The core technology in this project combines an acid-enhanced crosslinking chemistry with optimized reaction conditions to thermally stabilize polyolefin materials, enabling them to become efficient carbon precursors with at least 65% yield after high temperature pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere. This process is cost-effective and potentially may be scaled to produce carbons with high degree of graphitization, high porosity, and heteroatom-doped framework. Moreover, the simplicity of this process allows for efficient transformation towards industrially relevant scales through careful system design. Building upon the understanding of the fundamental relationship between processing conditions and resulting material properties, this technology also enables easy control over thermal and electrical conductivity, adsorption performance, and mechanical properties of resulting carbon additives by manipulating processing conditions. Successful commercialization and timely distribution of this technology would lead to an economically feasible solution to address at least millions of tons of plastic waste, which directly tackles one of the most pressing environmental and societal challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
