 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology-Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (CREST-PRF) track within the CREST program supports beginning CREST Center investigators with significant potential and provides them with training and research experiences that will broaden perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, and establish them in positions of leadership within the scientific community. This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Security and Privacy Enhanced Cloud Computing (C-SPECC) at the University of Texas San Antonio. The goal of this research is to fill the gap in Access Control in the rapidly growing domains of smart home Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)\r\n\r\nThis project will systematically investigate smart home IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) domains to develop formal scientific foundations and models for Access Control (AC). The proposed work will design and/or adapt appropriate access control-oriented architecture for each domain. The AC requirements and challenges for the layers in each architecture will be investigated and an AC framework described for the interactions between layers. AC models for the interactions between each layer will be described. The PI will develop teaching and mentoring skills, obtain additional specialization, and obtain guidance with respect to the faculty search process. The proposed work has the potential to establish an independent research pathway for the postdoctoral research fellow.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
