 "awd_abstract_narration": "MSRI-UP is a Research Experience for Undergraduates program that identifies talented undergraduates \u2014particularly those from groups underrepresented in mathematics\u2014 who display great mathematical potential despite having had limited opportunities and experience. MSRI-UP provides students with the research experience, training, long-term mentorship, and social support necessary to pursue a graduate degree and career in the mathematical sciences. The MSRI-UP is led by a team of directors who have substantial experience creating a rigorous and supportive research environment that emphasizes collaboration and communication and encourages the active participation and success of every student. This guarantees a high-quality research experience that leads to presentations at national conferences and frequently to publications in refereed journals.\r\n\r\nMSRI-UP contributes significantly to increasing the number of graduate degrees in mathematics earned by U.S. students and by members of underserved communities. The program, partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, includes a six-week summer research experience, colloquia and professional development workshops, the opportunity to present at national conferences, an introduction to a wide community of peers and mentors, and long-term follow-up and mentorship. Each year, the mathematical activities are directed by a different research leader who is an expert in an active area of research and an established mentor, to ensure that MSRI-UP will contribute to the diversity of different fields of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
