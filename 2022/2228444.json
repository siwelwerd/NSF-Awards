 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Central Florida and its partners, including the City of Orlando, have identified a recurring need for \u201cequitable resilience\u201d in response to climate-related disasters, such as hurricanes, that lead to significant loss of power and connectivity. Historically marginalized groups and lower-income populations have higher energy burdens, less access to generators, and reduced internet access, and are especially susceptible to external shocks that threaten community resilience. For these reasons, this project will co-create a design for an equity-centered, portable resilience hub and education center tailored for Central Florida and the Orlando community. This project calls this a Resilience, Education, and Advocacy Center for Hazard preparedness, or REACH hubs, which will provide pre- and post-disaster necessities and connectivity and serve as hands-on STEM education centers during non-emergency times. In collaboration with state and local governments, multiple community partners, and local youth, this project will use a community-engaged approach to put underserved communities in front of what we do to co-design mutually beneficial REACH hubs. With strategic placement of the REACH hubs in socioeconomically vulnerable parts of Orlando, the proposed hubs will improve disaster response and recovery in a more equitable way. The hubs will contribute to local sustainability goals by operating on clean, solar energy, and the design process will consider how to scale or modify for other hurricane prone, peninsular, or island locations.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives for the planning grant are to: (1) consider and incorporate diverse community needs in REACH hub design and deployment, (2) develop technical specifications for the solar-powered hub, (3) design sensor data packaging and integration, (4) build a strong interdisciplinary team and research agenda, and (5) scale and modify for other hurricane-prone communities. We will use partner agency and community workshops for collecting community feedback to design all elements of the hubs. This project will also develop a modular design for our resilience hub that will use commercialized technologies of long-duration batteries, cost effective and highly durable PV modules, 5G communication, wireless charging, and user interfaces. Based on existing and planned smart devices in the City of Orlando\u2019s Future-Ready program, this project will use cutting-edge cloud/edge techniques to integrate sensor data related to our REACH hubs, analyze using artificial intelligence techniques, and package for STEM education. In addition, this will create an inventory of existing and planned resilience assets in Central Florida to help inform the prioritization scheme for REACH hub locations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Building beyond the successful practice of resilience hubs in other urban areas of the U.S., our Resilience, Education, and Advocacy Center for Hazard preparedness, or REACH hub that we designed will provide pre- and post-disaster (i.e., &ldquo;gray skies&rdquo;) necessities and connectivity and serve as hands-on STEM education centers during non-emergency times (i.e., &ldquo;blue skies&rdquo;) by need-based mobile deployment. We put vulnerable communities in front of what we do by listening and incorporating community feedback to develop the technical specifications for the solar-powered, modular hub that can be scaled for other hurricane-prone communities.</p>\n<p>During Stage 1 we facilitated several community engagement activities in order to co-create a resilience hub design focused on equitable resilience and connectivity. These activities, participation, and key outcomes are summarized in Figure 2. Through surveys, stakeholder meetings, listening sessions with Orlando youth and adults working with youth, and one-on-one meetings with potential community partners to host the hub, we identified the following values and design specifications for the hub: equitable, transportable, accessible, educational, STEM-focused, connected, modular, environmentally sustainable, and economically efficient. Through consultation with an architect familiar with building resilient and sustainable structures, we developed the architectural design seen in Figure 3 that incorporates the values identified by the community.</p>\n<p>Our REACH hub design not only features state-of-the-art solar energy technologies, but also serves as a showcase of future energy efficiency. The proposed resilience hub design uses a hybrid DC-AC circuit that allows efficient, flexible, and evolving operation of power generation and appliance assets. It is modularly designed to get its energy from a combination of blue-sky grid connection, photovoltaic panels, battery storage, and gas-propane generators.</p>\n<p>In Stage 1, we also developed preliminary programs for education and information sharing to accompany the REACH hub in blue and gray-skies. With blue-skies programming focused on STEM-education, we will include virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) learning stations that allow participants to immerse and explore the topics of equitable resilience. Community members will be asked to identify signs of vulnerability and strengths/resiliency in their local community through a community photovoice workshop, where the results will be displayed on the REACH hub website and display screens seen on the hub. In gray-skies, the REACH hub display screens and website will share key information related to disaster preparation identified by stakeholders and community members (Figure 2), such as power outages, road closures, and storm information.</p>\n<p>Next, we developed plans to continue co-design of the REACH hub with and for the community through the construction and demonstration phases of the project in Stage 2. We created a plan for hub demonstrations at a Boys &amp; Girls Club of Central Florida clubhouse and urban farm located in downtown Orlando once the hub is constructed. From these demonstrations, the research team will collect data from users in the piloted neighborhoods on the actual utilization of the hub functionalities (e.g., risk communication, cooling, phone charging, water, ice, and food pickup, etc.) and from operators and maintenance personnel on the facility status (e.g., potential damage from wind, flood, and sunlight exposure) and connectivity to the control center from City of Orlando.</p>\n<p>Finally, we developed a resilience hub scalability design identifying the six main steps to replicate a similar co-design process in other communities (Figure 4), which focuses upon the key steps of resilience hub development while allowing individualization and customization. If successful, multiple REACH hubs could be built and deployed in a region using the process, technologies, and engagement opportunities selected for the pilot REACH hub.</p>\n<p>By designing REACH hubs with community input for Central Florida, we will create a modular, scalable, and readily deployable technology to support urban resilience in disaster prone areas. With strategic placement of the REACH hubs in socioeconomically vulnerable parts of Orlando, our hubs will improve disaster response and recovery in disadvantaged areas to further equitable resilience. We rely on community engagement throughout the design, build, and demonstration process, which will increase community capacity, revitalization, and empowerment. By providing power-related necessities and internet connectivity, REACH hubs will assist with energy burdens and the urban digital divide. Our modular design incorporates how to scale or modify for other hurricane prone communities and use by various community organizations under blue or gray skies. By structuring the hub so that services are accessible from outside of the structure, our design can serve more people and accommodate persons of varying abilities. It is our vision that the REACH hub will be part of a suite of resilience assets developed by the City of Orlando to improve equitable resilience and inclusion in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Kelly&nbsp;Stevens</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028046678_Figure_1_REACH_hub_design--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028046678_Figure_1_REACH_hub_design--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REACH Design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028046678_Figure_1_REACH_hub_design--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REACH Design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REACH hub designed in Stage 1 that will be built in Stage 2 with exterior inflatable AC tent.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KMF Architects</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kelly&nbsp;Stevens\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REACH Design</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028123952_Figure_3_Architectural_Design--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028123952_Figure_3_Architectural_Design--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Architectural Design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028123952_Figure_3_Architectural_Design--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Architectural Design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Architectural design of REACH hub including annotated clay renderings (top and middle), exploded axon image (left), and overhead plan (bottom) with annotation legend (right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KMF Architects</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kelly&nbsp;Stevens\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Architectural Design</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028166765_Figure_4_Scalability_design--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028166765_Figure_4_Scalability_design--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scalability Design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028166765_Figure_4_Scalability_design--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scalability Design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Resilience hub scalability design developed in Stage 1 for the REACH hub.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kelly&nbsp;Stevens\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Scalability Design</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028081955_Figure_2_Stage_1_Feedback--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028081955_Figure_2_Stage_1_Feedback--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Community Feedback\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2228444/2228444_10831651_1720028081955_Figure_2_Stage_1_Feedback--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Community Feedback\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Key takeaways from community engagement activities for the REACH hub in Stage 1.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kelly&nbsp;Stevens\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Community Feedback</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
