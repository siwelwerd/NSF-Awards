 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to human-induced climate change due to its global warming potential, which is 34 times greater than that of CO2. Microorganisms in wet landscapes tend to release methane, whereas those in dry ones tend to take up the gas from Earth's atmosphere.  Researchers at the Howland Research Forest in Maine have been measuring methane fluctuations across this sub-boreal forest since 2012. Their studies have found that the forest usually serves as a methane \"sink\" due to microbial consumption, although occasionally, under extremely wet conditions, the reverse can be true.  This research site provides an ideal opportunity to study the conditions under which a forest would switch from a net sink to become a source of atmospheric methane. Under future climate change scenarios, the region is expected to become warmer and wetter, conditions that may induce a shift from methane sink to source, with the potential to have an impact on atmospheric methane concentrations at regional to global scale. This project will examine how forest soil microbial communities will change in response to climate warming, to identify the conditions that may lead forests to switch from being a methane sink to more of a source. The project will also support the cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral research scholars, including those from underrepresented groups in science. A series of public talks will be convened, and short videos and StoryMaps focused on science outreach will be paired with \u201cscientist in the classroom\u201d visits to local high schools. The project will host an open house for students and the public at the Howland Research Forest to learn about this important research. \r\n\r\nThis study aims to identify - through the integration of field observations, laboratory analyses, and modeling - the conditions and mechanisms driving methane sink vs source activity in forests, using the Howland Research Forest in Maine as a case study. The project's novel approach focuses on three key areas to improve understanding of methane in such habitats: 1) identify the roles and response of soil microbial communities, specifically, methanogens and methanotrophs (and their functional guilds), in driving methane flux across environmental gradients; 2) understand and quantify how wet vs dry landscape microsites, and belowground vs. aboveground components within a forest contribute to seasonal and annual methane fluxes; and 3) integrate knowledge gained from field and laboratory analyses to inform and improve ecosystem process models. A suite of in-situ and lab-based experimental measures of methane production and oxidation, stable isotopes, and profiles of microbial community composition and function will be used to understand the mechanisms, processes, and feedbacks driving methane sink/source activity from site to landscape levels. At the site level, multi-scale observations of soil and aboveground methane fluxes, microbial traits, and associated in-situ environmental conditions will be obtained. To further understand and quantify methane response, in-situ and laboratory manipulation experiments to identify the role of functional guild activity, under changing environmental conditions, in regulating methane production/oxidation and ultimately net methane flux to and from the atmosphere will be employed. Finally, these data, integrated with project data-enhanced Microbial Model for Methane Dynamics-Dual Arrhenius Michaels Menten (M3D-DAMM) and Community Land Model-Microbe (CLM-Microbe) process models, will allow researchers to identify seasonal and annual methane sink/source activity at the landscape level within Howland Forest from the present to 2100. The research will include training at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, as well as a variety of outreach activities to engage high school students and the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
