 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) at The Ohio State University stores, amplifies and distributes seeds, plasmid clones and other resources of Arabidopsis thaliana, a key model system for plant research. These have included DNA libraries, cDNA collections, various mutant seed populations and germ plasm from across the globe that represent the immense natural genetic variation of the species. For 30 years, the ABRC has had a global role in facilitating essential and fundamental plant research. ABRC resources have promoted discovery in photosynthesis and all aspects of plant development that have been instrumental in promoting agricultural improvement, green technology, and basic medical research. This award will support the ABRC's core mission to inexpensively distribute DNA and seed resources to the plant biology community, and to support plant science education by providing seeds and teaching resources free-of-charge to K-12 teachers. This project continues the mission of the ABRC to enlarge and expand the collection though acquisition of new resources while at the same time increasing the efficiency of the operation. Substantial outreach and education efforts will allow the ABRC to be a leader in local, national and international outreach and education, providing opportunities to inspire and train future generations of plant scientists.\r\n\r\nThis project will maintain and increase the current high levels of resource distribution, particularly for seed stocks. The ABRC will maintain quality control testing with an emphasis on stocks that are ordered frequently, stocks in long term storage, and those known to require special storage conditions. The Center will expand the collection through the collaborative inclusion of additional Brassicaceae species, especially Thlaspi arvense (pennycress), a species that has potential oil crop and biodiesel applications. Outreach activities, both local and national, will include the development and solicitation of new education resources and that expands the reach of our successful outreach programming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) was established in 1991 as a repository for the large numbers of seed and plasmid stocks of the model organism <em>Arabidopsis thaliana </em>(Arabidopsis) generated by researchers around the world. The primary goal of the Center is the preservation, amplification and distribution of these stocks to the worldwide research and education community. Regular activities include collection and curation of new stocks, growing new and low volume stocks to ensure adequate viable seed availability, storage of stocks under low temperature, low humidity conditions to optimize their longevity, and the efficient and timely distribution of stocks to the community. ABRC also collects and develops resources for use in schools and universities and engages in community events to promote awareness of plants and plant science.

Conversion of approximately 100 frequently ordered clones to a dry format which does not require refrigeration for storage or distribution was accomplished in year 1 and distribution of stocks in this format was trialed in year 2. An advanced programming interface (API) was also developed and deployed in year 2 allowing collaborators direct access to the ABRC database.

Improvements to curator functions included increased ability to update stock and payment information through the web application and functionality allowing curators to add a message to all webpages to communicate known issues and outages to users. The ABRC database and web application were also moved to new hardware hosted by the College of Arts and Sciences allowing faster deploys of updates and bug fixes and saving on monthly hosting costs. During the award period the ABRC added a total of 1,094 new lines to the collection and distributed 221,477 samples to 3,048 individuals in the United States and 51 other countries. 11,559 stocks were grown for seed increase and quality control testing was performed on 8,021 stocks. 1,061 education kits were distributed and outreach activities reached over 2,000 individuals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/07/2025<br>\nModified by: David&nbsp;E&nbsp;Somers</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
