 "awd_abstract_narration": "While many efforts have begun to increase the diversity of learners in computing fields, more inclusive approaches are needed to support learners with intersectional identities across gender, race, ethnicity, and ability. This workshop aims to catalyze conversation and collaboration around gender identity and intersectionality in broadening participation in computing efforts. The workshop will be led by SageFox Consulting, a woman-owned research and evaluation firm specializing in equity in STEM and computing education, and will bring together experts from a range of computing and social science disciplines. The outputs from this workshop have the potential to improve the collective capacity to weave intersectionality into research, policy, and practice agendas across the Computing Education Research community.\r\n \r\nThis workshop will bring together experts across a range of computing and related technical and data-based disciplines as well as experts from other fields in the social sciences including education and the learning sciences to build an intersectional policy, practices, and research agenda that is inclusive of gender identity in broadening participation in computing (BPC) efforts. The workshop will be guided by the principles of intersectionality to engage in a set of curated learning and working activities to accomplish the following objectives: (1) Define near and long term agenda items for intersectional research about the inclusion of gender identity in the Computing Education Research community; (2) Advance collective understanding of and ability to implement principles of intersectionality in future work; (3) Highlight existing work, researchers, and thought leaders on the inclusion of gender identity in BPC/RPP initiatives; (4) Create a community where gender expansive work is valued and valuable for those doing, receiving, and being represented by this work; (5) Provide participants with the opportunity to conceptualize how to expand and refine the inclusion of gender identity as part of their current and future BPC initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
