This award supports theoretical and computational research and education focused on interacting electrons confined to two-dimensions, \u201cflatland,\u201d and with phenomena that occur when they are cooled to very low temperatures and exposed to a high magnetic field. This system of elections which can be realized at the interface of two semiconductors is known to produce very unusual quantum mechanical phases of matter, most notably those for which a component of resistance, known as the Hall resistance, to the flow of electrical current is a multiple of a quantum of resistance that is independent of the material and depends only on fundamental constants like the charge of an electron. That this macroscopic resistance becomes quantized was unexpected; this phenomenon is called the fractional quantum Hall effect. It has served as the springboard for the advent of new phenomena that occur in two-dimensional quantum materials, such as semiconductor structures known as quantum wells, single and multi-layer graphene, and a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides that may be an alternative to graphene for some technical applications. An additional aspect of these systems is the emergence of new and exotic types of particles, which are not found elsewhere in nature, and which have generated innovative ideas for future quantum device technologies. \r\nTo gain further insight into the fractional Hall effect, the PI will investigate the consequences of a model interaction that is exactly solvable and exhibits several aspects of the observed phenomenology of the fractional quantum Hall effect.  A crucial aspect in which this model deviates from the previous models is that the interaction is taken to be infinitely strong compared to the kinetic energy. This project involves the investigation of exactly solvable models to provide useful insights into existing concepts and to reveal fruitful new directions of inquiry to advance understanding of the fascinating physic of electrons confined to two dimensions. Aspects of the fractional quantum Hall effects that will be investigated include proposed new particles that are fundamentally different from the electron or photon - the quantum of light, and proposed particles that behave as if they were a fraction of an electron. The PI also plans to explore generalizations to other physical systems beyond electrons in \u201cflatland.\u201d \r\n \r\nThe students supported by this project will be trained in advanced numerical techniques, analytical field theoretical methods, topological concepts, and high-performance computing. They will also be exposed to international collaboration. Participation in various education and outreach activities will be an integral part of their training because it not only promotes public understanding of the STEM fields but also is of utmost importance for the professional growth of the graduate students and will help build essential skills that will serve them well in their future careers.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to investigate new directions in the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect.  This effect has given rise to new concepts, such as particles with fractional charge and fractional statistics, composite fermions, topological superconductivity, Majorana fermions, and chiral Luttinger liquids. Some of these have found homes in other platforms and have driven ideas related to topological quantum computation. Exact parent Hamiltonians have been constructed for certain fractional quantum Hall wave functions, the earliest example being Haldane\u2019s model that obtained the Laughlin wave function as the exact ground state. These models assume that the cyclotron energy is infinitely large compared to the interaction energy, so that electrons are confined to the lowest Landau level. \r\nThe primary objective of this project will be to investigate several directions opened by a recently developed model that considers an interaction that is infinitely strong compared to the cyclotron energy and is solvable for all eigenstates and eigen-energies. Various topological features will be explicitly evaluated from the exact wave functions, which have a rather complex form. In particular, the entanglement spectrum and braid statistics of the quasiparticles will be evaluated. The wave functions will be extended to the spherical and torus geometries, which should bring out their topological character. The physics of pairing instability and of non-Abelian statistics will be addressed within this model, which will also be generalized to fractional quantum Hall effects of bosons, spinful electrons and bilayer systems, and to include structures inspired by the parton construction. An important goal will be to ascertain what aspects of the solution relate to the laboratory experiments and whether hitherto unknown structures emerge. \r\n\r\nThe students supported by this project will employ advanced analytical as well as computational techniques, such as Chern-Simons field theory, exact diagonalization studies, and quantum Monte Carlo method. They will also organize education and outreach activities for pre-college students at appropriate summer camps at Penn State as well as at the annual Arts Festival at State College.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Prominent among these is the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect, which provides a new paradigm for collective behavior in nature.&nbsp;The physics of this effect is dominated by the inter-particle interaction because the kinetic energy levels of electrons in a magnetic field, called Landau levels (LLs), are flat.&nbsp;While much of the phenomenology of the FQH effect is well-explained both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of the formation of particles called the composite fermions (CFs), many important questions remain. Certain observations are not understood at all while some others are understood qualitatively but have resisted a quantitative confirmation. We briefly describe the outcomes of our research supported by our two-year long NSF grant.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CF pairing</strong>: While the state at half-filled lowest Landau level is a strongly correlated Fermi liquid of the CFs, experiments in early 1990s discovered a FQH state here when the width of the quantum well was increased beyond a critical value. The nature of this state remained controversial for three decades, however. We have developed a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer inspired theory of CF pairing to address this problem, which has revealed an instability of the CF Fermi liquid into a p-wave paired state of the CFs with increasing width (shown schematically in image 1). The calculated phase diagram as a function of the quantum well width and the electron density is in excellent agreement with the measured one. This is significant because this paired CF state, in contrast to a competing two-component state, is predicted to support &ldquo;non-Abelian quasiparticles&rdquo; which may provide a possible route to quantum computation. We have further predicted that an f-wave pairing occurs at quarter filling. Finally, we have found that the &frac12; state seen in a higher LL of monolayer graphene results from an f-wave pairing of the CFs. The different kinds of CF pairing can be distinguished experimentally by, for example, thermal Hall effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Theory of STM</strong>: Dramatic recent progress in using scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) to probe the FQH states motivated us to study the problem theoretically. This problem is conceptually interesting and nontrivial because it deals with the addition or removal of an electron, which is a very complicated bound state when viewed from the perspective of the CFs (see image 2). Our detailed calculations predict multiple, nearly equally spaced peaks in the STM signal which can be qualitatively understood in terms of excitations of the CFs within this bound state. The STM studies provide a unique window into the short-distance correlations in the FQH effect and our work should prove useful in the analysis of future experiments.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Exact models</strong>: Some of the FQH ground states are known to be exact solutions for certain model interactions. In particular, in early 1990s a model was written which produced exact solutions for the ground state as well as its non-Abelian quasiholes, but not for its quasiparticles. We have constructed a model involving multiple LLs which provides exact solutions for the ground state, forquasiholes <em>and</em>&nbsp;for quasiparticles, thus placing the concept of such statistics, in principle, on a firmer footing.&nbsp;We have also constructed a model interaction consisting of a short range two-body interaction and a carefully designed three-body interaction, which produces the &ldquo;unprojected&rdquo; CF wavefunction for the 3/7 state as the exact and unique ground state within the Hilbert space of the lowest three LLs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interference and fractional braid statistics</strong>: A remarkable theoretical prediction of the FQH theories is the existene of excitations that have fractional charge and that obey fractional braid statistics. During the past few years, experiments have seen evidence of fractional statistics by measuring phase slips in the interference patterns which are attributed to the addition of a single quasiparticle or quasihole inside the interference loop. We have addressed the issue of how the observations may be understood without assuming sharply quantized fractional charge or statistics at the edges of the sample. We have also proposed a geometry which should allow a measurement of the braid statistics using a closed tunneling loop confined entirely within the bulk of a FQH state.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In summary, we have made progress in clarifying the underlying physics of several interesting experiments. We believe that some of these ideas will also be of relevance to the recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, namely observation of FQH effect without a magnetic field.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/04/2025<br>\nModified by: Jainendra&nbsp;K&nbsp;Jain</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2037990/2037990_10777473_1736046053445_1736045783041_7b24dd3b_49ab_4dc2_b66a_d9ba06b1b4eb_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2037990/2037990_10777473_1736046053445_1736045783041_7b24dd3b_49ab_4dc2_b66a_d9ba06b1b4eb_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pairing instability of composite fermions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2037990/2037990_10777473_1736046053445_1736045783041_7b24dd3b_49ab_4dc2_b66a_d9ba06b1b4eb_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pairing instability of composite fermions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Fermi sea of composite fermions (electrons with two flux quanta bound) at half filled Landau level becomes unstable to pairing with increasing quantum well width.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">A.
