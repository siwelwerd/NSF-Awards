 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a microfluidics-based diagnostic device that facilitates lab-quality analytics in a compact platform that may be operated outside of the laboratory environment. The proposed technology is especially ideal for roadside drug detection, first responders, emergency medicine, sports anti-doping, pain management, rehab centers, onsite workforce drug testing and other applications. The drug abuse testing market is projected to be $11.83B globally by 2025. The legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use, the opioid crisis, and emerging dangerous designer drugs have generated high interest in technologies that reduce the economic impact and public health burden of drug abuse in the US and abroad. The initial target market is law enforcement drug testing, which has minimal regulatory burden, immediate need and high growth potential, with planned expansion into workforce and clinical drug testing market segments over time. This technology also has utility in the wider point-of-care diagnostics market, which is projected to be more than $50B globally by 2026. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a microfluidics device that facilitates the recirculation of fluid in a microfluidic channel. The proposed approach is key to detecting low abundance targets in small volumes of fluid. Recirculation is achieved by a pump incorporated into the disposable microfluidic device that is actuated by a stepper motor in the reader. Depression and withdrawal of the actuator creates a pulsatile flow across a biosensor. Sample, reagents, and wash buffers may be recirculated at the desired rate and time interval needed for optimal assay performance. The proposed recirculation flow method is packaged into a fully integrated lab-on-a-chip device capable of processing small volumes of whole blood, oral fluid, and other biological matrices. The fluidic layout facilitates processing complex multistep immunoassay sequences. The lab-on-a-chip device is outfitted with a high-density microarray biosensor for unparalleled multiplexing capability. In addition, the platform includes a compact, highly portable, battery-powered reader to work with the cartridge. Fluorescent images of the sensor response are captured by a CCD inside the instrument. Data is automatically analyzed and reported to the user on screen on the instrument and transmitted to a mobile App.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
