 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research conference \"Homological Commutative Algebra and Related Topics and their Applications.\"  This international conference will be held at Georgia Southern University's Armstrong Campus in Savannah, Georgia during May 13-15, 2022. The main goal of the meeting is to bring together a diverse group of researchers from a mixture of fields, and in different stages of their careers, in a forum where they will be able to exchange and build on their mathematical ideas and work.  In particular, the conference will highlight the recent results and developments in homological commutative algebra and will further connect with several fields of mathematics, including combinatorics, geometry, number theory, and others.  The event will include established and early-career mathematicians, as well as post-doctoral fellows and students, allowing collaborations, networking, and professional development between these different groups.  Special care will be taken to ensure participation from women and researchers in underrepresented groups to enhance and promote diversity and inclusion in the mathematical sciences. The  expected outcome is to support and promote these mathematical topics for students and researchers in the southeastern region and beyond. \r\n\r\nHomological algebra originated from algebraic topology as a tool used in the commutative algebra localization conjecture of regular local rings.  Subsequently, homological algebra has become a major subdiscipline of commutative algebra.  The conference activities will address many connections between homological commutative algebra and other mathematical disciplines.  Specifically, the event includes discussions on fundamental problems in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, representation theory, combinatorics, deformation theory, category theory, rational homotopy theory, and other related areas.  It will follow a typical format with research talks in conjunction with collaboration opportunities, and it will feature a mix of 50-minute research talks given by established mathematicians and 25-minute presentations from early-career researchers.  For more information, see the conference webpage https://sites.google.com/georgiasouthern.edu/commutative-algebra-conference/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
