 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a dual transmission X-ray diffractometer (DTXRD) that allows researchers to study how materials form, how their atoms are arranged, and how they can be manipulated and engineered. The arrangement of these sub-nanometer (< 1 billionth of a meter) building blocks determines the materials properties and behavior in varying environments. Consequentially, understanding their structure is a powerful tool for materials discovery and design to unlock next-generation batteries, sensors, magnets, electronics, catalysts, polymers, and quantum materials. The instrument benefits researchers across a wide range of disciplines (chemistry, biochemistry, earth/planetary and materials science, physics, mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering) at Arizona State University (ASU). The DTXRD further enables fundamental insights into how the local and long-range arrangement of atoms evolve in response to external parameters (different temperatures, gas, electrical/electrochemical fields) and reveals synthetic formation mechanisms of novel materials. Hence, the instrument allows for crucial materials research that is key for innovation and leads to future technology development. This has an impact not only across multiple disciplines but also transcending further to US-wide academic institutions, including universities with limited research opportunities for students, and industrial partners. The DTXRD provides a unique and powerful learning experience for students through hands-on training and research activities, as well as online courses on crystallography and materials synthesis, creating a workforce that enriches many different industrial sectors ranging from energy and information technology to packaging and waste management. Additionally, public outreach in the form of workshops, lectures, and accessible social media content promote the broad area of materials science and facilitate science communication and networking. \r\n\r\nThe DTXRD combines two independent and simultaneously operable systems to enable: (i) X-ray diffraction measurements with copper (Cu) or molybdenum (Mo) radiation in transmission geometry (maximizing data quality, especially for layered and 2D materials) that can be performed in capillaries (ideal for air-sensitive compounds) and in an automated way (up to 30 samples), and (ii) Total scattering experiments and pair distribution function analysis using high energy (silver (Ag) radiation) for local structure information of crystalline as well as low- and non-crystalline species, including a reaction chamber and variable temperature capabilities (40 - 1,800 K and gas atmosphere). The high energy radiation also enables operando transmission diffraction measurements of electrochemical devices with coin and pouch cell holders. The DTXRD is used for research projects in three general areas: (1) Understanding the local structure and developing new synthetic reaction pathways for layered, low crystalline, non-crystalline or amorphous, and low-dimensional materials; (2) Mechanistic understanding of materials for renewable energy/catalysis applications; (3) Discovery of new quantum phases in quantum sciences and engineering. The overarching goal within these broad research fields is to develop a deep understanding of the structure of diverse species (ranging from solid-state battery and magnetic materials to minerals and organics/polymers), their formation mechanisms, and their behavior in response to external stimuli (including their potential degradation and failure). This knowledge is crucial for the understanding and design of next generation materials for electrochemical energy, semiconductor, catalysis, and quantum computing applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
