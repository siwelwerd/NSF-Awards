The 27th edition of this prestigious conference will be held at the Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, on July 25-29, 2022. The primary topic of the conference concerns large scale scientific computing problems, which are an important and very general interdisciplinary research field and plays a crucial role in many application areas, for example weather forecast, seismic predictions, fluid simulations, material industry, oil field exploration, medical imaging, among others. This project will enable US based junior researchers to travel to the conference, network, and present their research.\r\n\r\nThe International Conference of Domain Decomposition Methods is the only regularly occurring international forum dedicated to interdisciplinary technical interactions between theoreticians and practitioners working in the development, analysis, software implementation, and application of domain decomposition methods, which are important in scientific computing. The complexity and size of such problems often lead to very large systems, where massive computing resources and special computational approaches must be employed to obtain approximate solutions. As we approach the dawn of exascale computing, scalable techniques such as DDM are vital tools for solving complex problems that would otherwise be intractable.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
