 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social studies classrooms play a critical role in teaching students about countries outside of their home country, and yet there is very little comprehensive information on what and how students learn about the home countries of new immigrants. This project investigates how lessons about the home countries and regions of new immigrants are taught to students in the country that receives these new immigrants. The PIs use a city with a rich history of both immigration and civil rights activism to situate their case study that examines the sociological and anthropological implications of incorporating lessons about new immigrants' home countries into pedagogical practices of  the classroom. Additionally, the project will investigate the impact of an interdisciplinary methods workshop at four historical black colleges/universities (HBCUs) that will bring researchers from across the country to collaborate and exchange methodological innovations.\r\n\r\nThis research uses interdisciplinary methods to assess the following: 1) how lessons on the home countries and regions of new immigrants are designed and articulated in the middle school curricula of the country that receives these new immigrants; 2) how teachers actually present this material in their middle school classrooms; 3) how students are receive lessons on these countries and regions; and 4) the impact of an interdisciplinary workshop on undergraduate students at three minority-serving institutions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, surveys, and ethnography, will be used to address these research questions. This project will advance knowledge in the fields of sociology, anthropology, and education. It will also provide research training and scientific publishing opportunities for underrepresented students at an all-women's MSI and foster interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty at three other MSIs. The research will contribute to broader national conversations on inclusion and curricula, and will be disseminated nationally through the development of curricular materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
