 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry is sponsoring this workshop entitled \"CAS-Climate: Materials Chemistry in Electrochemical Energy Storage\" to be held on September 26-30, 2022 at the Telluride Science Research Center (TSRC), Telluride, Colorado.  Battery technologies play a leading role in harnessing renewable energy and combating global warming and environmental challenges caused by current dependence on fossil fuel.   In the meantime, rapidly increasing energy storage demands for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, electrical grids, and clean energy storage raise the level of urgency for the development of advanced rechargeable batteries with superior energy storage performance compared to the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries.  This workshop will focus on the mechanistic understanding and exploration of materials chemistry in electrochemical energy storage, including in lithium ion batteries, multivalent batteries, and redox flow batteries. This workshop aims to gather established leaders and emerging investigators to exchange novel ideas and address materials challenges in energy storage science.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tianbiao Liu from the Chemistry Department of Utah State University is organizing this workshop.  There are five sub-topics: (i)  lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, (ii) beyond lithium ion batteries, (iii) electrolyte and interfacial chemistry, (iv) batteries for scalable energy storage, and (v) advanced characterization and computational modeling.  Through these discussions, the workshop participants will share knowledge and exchange perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for chemistry in the field of electrochemical energy storage. The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated to the scientific community via a workshop report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
