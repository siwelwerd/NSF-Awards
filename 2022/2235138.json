 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reef benthic community assemblage and functioning are controlled in part by herbivores that graze on algae, which compete for space with various taxa, including coral and sponge species. In the Caribbean, it is hypothesized that the black sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, is a keystone grazer that controls macroalgae species composition and biomass at low levels and facilitates the recruitment and survival of reef-building corals, leading to a coral-dominated state of reefs. The recent D. antillarum die-off provides the conditions of a natural removal experiment useful to understand the top-down control exertion of this herbivore, especially by quantifying the spatial arrangement progression of benthic functional groups across urchin abundances. This study is assessing the impact of the loss of this keystone species on reef community structure and function using innovative imaging tools to quantify the fine-scale changes in the community structure, the size distribution, and spatial dispersion of D. antillarum, the dominant coral species (Porites), and turf-algae and macroalgae on the reefs of Culebra, Puerto Rico, during the initial phase of the Diadema die-off in the Caribbean.  The Caribbean-wide D. antillarum die-off highlights the importance of understanding how and when herbivores play a role in shaping reef communities. This RAPID award is creating a rich digital dataset that will be leveraged to assess multiple ecological questions and provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate and graduate research studies.\r\n\r\nThe loss of this keystone species is expected to impact overall reef community structure and function and the abundance and distribution of coral turf-algae and macroalgae.  The project uses innovative spatially explicit tools to quantify the fine-scale spatiotemporal changes in the community structure, size distribution, and spatial dispersion of D. antillarum, Porites astreoides (dominant coral species), and turf-algae and macroalgae (Dictyota spp.) on the reefs of Culebra, Puerto Rico, during the initial phase of the Diadema die-off in the Caribbean. Based on top-down control, competition, and percolation theory, the investigators hypothesize (H1) a strong relationship between D. antillarum and the community structure of reefs, (H2) an increase in macroalgae/turf algae cover starting with a non-uniform dispersion of algae clumps, followed by the coalescing of algae clumps percolated across the reefs and around P. asteroides colonies, which will result in (H3) a decrease of P. asteroides demographic parameters (e.g., growth, size-structure, recruitment) due to smothering, shading, and interactive effects with algae. They hypothesize (H4) that the trophic dynamics of reefs will shift, especially by the diversification of basal resources and expansion of trophic niches of consumers. The investigators are using Structure-from-Motion software to create large-area images that reproduce a digital reconstruction of reef plots. They leverage data from an existing project in Culebra (Puerto Rico) that has collected over 90 high resolution (cm-scale), large-area images (LAIs, 100 m2) since 2020.  They are generating bi-monthly LAIs (8 time points) to assess the fine-scale and fast responses as a function of the die-off. Samples across different basal resources and trophic guilds/levels are being collected to perform stable isotope analysis and Bayesian mixing models to quantify shifts in trophic dynamics due to the response of the reef community to the urchin die-off. These research activities follow an analytical framework based on a before-and-after experimental approach and high-resolution temporal trends. Different statistical modeling techniques are being incorporated in this framework to address the projects' hypotheses and synergistic activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project aimed to assess how the loss of<em> D. antillarum</em> impacts reef community structure, algae growth, coral populations, and reef food webs. Using cutting-edge spatial tools and ecological analysis, the study focused on reefs around Culebra, Puerto Rico, with three key objectives: tracking urchin and algae abundance over time, understanding <em>D. antillarum</em>&rsquo;s role in shaping reef communities, and examining changes in food web dynamics.<br /><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Activities</strong><br />To address the study goal, we conducted multiple field trips between 2022 and 2024, collecting data through advanced imaging techniques like large-area imaging (LAI) and photogrammetry. Over 384 reef plots were analyzed, generating detailed 3D models to measure urchin populations, algae cover, and coral health. Laboratory work included delineation of coral colonies and algae patches using LAIs, and stable isotope analysis of 490 consumer and 87 producer samples to investigate trophic dynamics and energy flow within the ecosystem.<br /><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Findings</strong><br /><em>1. Decline in D. antillarum</em><br />The study confirmed a severe reduction in <em>D. antillarum</em> populations following the 2022 die-off, with no significant recovery observed even a year later. Urchin counts dropped by over 95% at both study sites, indicating a drastic loss of top-down control on algae growth.</p>\r\n<p><em>2. Changes in Reef Community Structure</em><br />The loss of urchins led to significant increases in macroalgae cover, which negatively impacted other reef organisms. For example, results suggest that sponges declined due to competition with algae. Based on percent cover estimates, coral cover showed minimal change, but when using population models, we learned that algae could have long-term impacts on coral populations via harmful effects of algae on coral growth and recruitment. For instance, coral population models indicated declining growth rates and survival, with projections showing potential extinction risks for stress-tolerant species like<em> Diploria labyrinthiformis</em> within 20 years.</p>\r\n<p><em>3. Shifts in Trophic Dynamics</em><br />Stable isotope analysis revealed that pelagic energy resources were a primary energy source for many species, but overall resource use changed over time. Specifically, omnivorous fish increased their reliance on native seagrass, while predator fish showed an increased reliance on algae energy sources over time. The analysis also highlighted niche partitioning, where different species reduced overlap in their resource use, reflecting adjustments to changing environmental conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br />The findings highlight <em>D. antillarum</em>&rsquo;s crucial role in maintaining coral reef ecosystems through its grazing on algae. Without this keystone herbivore, reefs face cascading effects, including algae overgrowth, reduced coral growth, and altered food webs. This research adds to the understanding of how top-down ecological processes and feedback mechanisms shape reef communities, offering valuable insights for conservation and management efforts. Also, the study emphasized the value of advanced imaging and AI-assisted tools in marine research. The high-resolution LAIs generated during the project can be revisited for future ecological studies, enabling long-term monitoring of coral reef dynamics.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Training and Professional Development</strong><br />The project provided hands-on training for one postdoc, three graduate students, four undergraduates, an intern, and two hired employees. Participants gained skills in photogrammetry, ecological data analysis, and AI tools like CoralNet for benthic cover analysis. Graduate students incorporated project findings into their research, while the intern applied their experience to produce a report on urchin population trends. The training and professional opportunities contributed to marine ecology and conservation workforce development.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />This research underscores the critical role of<em> D. antillarum</em> in maintaining healthy coral reefs and the wide-reaching effects of its decline. By combining innovative tools with rigorous ecological analysis, the study advances scientific understanding and provides practical insights for reef restoration and management in the face of ongoing environmental challenges.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/27/2024<br>\nModified by: Rolando&nbsp;O&nbsp;Santos</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2235138/2235138_10817162_1735310275227_Conceptual_Diagram--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2235138/2235138_10817162_1735310275227_Conceptual_Diagram--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project objectives conceptual diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2235138/2235138_10817162_1735310275227_Conceptual_Diagram--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project objectives conceptual diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Diagram illustrating the project objectives with associated expected results (hypotheses)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rolando O.
