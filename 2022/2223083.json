 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to derisk a new membrane manufacturing technology for biogas upgrading.  Renewable natural gas (RNG) is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source as it is derived from organic wastes such as food waste, agricultural waste, and municipal biosolids. RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.  The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.  These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.  The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, the  additive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.  The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity. The company will produce small membrane leaves up to 1 ft2 in area and demonstrate consistent performance across the leaf using mixed gas testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
