 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a Phase III renewal for an existing Industry University Cooperative Research Center - The Center for Tire Research (CenTiRe). CenTiRe is a collaboration between Virginia Tech and the University of Akron. With the advancements made in vehicle as well as road design, the demand on tire performance has increased tremendously. Therefore, the Center\u2019s mission is to push the boundaries of tire science and to better understand the complex interactions between the tire, road surface and the vehicle, and apply this knowledge to impact the competitiveness of the tire industry. To support this mission, the Virginia Tech (VT) site will conduct and disseminate innovative research and solutions in tire and vehicle modeling and simulation, tire-road interaction characterization and modeling (force and moment, friction and wear, noise, and vibration), related test equipment development, and intelligent tire system and the University of Akron (UA) will provide innovative research in tire materials, material models, simulation tools, test equipment, and manufacturing methods. In addition to its research efforts, the Center actively promotes the progress of science by directly supporting the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nCenTiRe disseminates innovations in tire science and technology by finding solutions for new materials, models, simulation tools, test equipment, and manufacturing methods. VT is globally known for tire and vehicle engineering and Phase III efforts will focus on research to better understand tire performance. This includes: tire and vehicle dynamic modeling; tire-road interaction modeling for friction, wear and noise; road profiling and friction estimation; and materials development for enhanced tire performance. The research team at UA complements those at VT particularly in the materials and sustainability thrust areas. UA teams make use of complex heterogenous dynamics in understanding performance of silica filled rubbers in tire tread compounds, recycling bottle grade plastics into technical grade fibers for tire reinforcements, understanding degradation of road wear particles, developing reliable aging model, and 3D printing process for manufacturing tire tread sensors. These technologies address the roadmap required for unmet and underserved industry needs including all-weather traction, durability, and environmental impact. CenTiRe sites prioritize developing a well-trained workforce by providing rigorous training for undergraduate and graduate students. Center societal impacts are equally emphasized through K-12 education, REU and outreach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
