 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a multi-drive rheometer equipped with custom, extreme-environment measurement suites. The instrument will be one of the most comprehensive rheometer systems in the world, with a previously unattainable range of testing capabilities. It will enable research on fundamental material properties for a wide range of materials used in additive manufacturing, thermochemical energy storage, drug delivery, soft robotics, and quiet drone propulsion systems. The state-of-the-art rheometry system will support the research, teaching, and outreach activities of numerous faculty and undergraduate/graduate student researchers at the University of Dayton and Central State University, a local historically black university. The instrument will be accessible as a shared facility, expanding the material characterization capabilities of the greater Dayton region and supporting educational opportunities for the next generation of scientists and engineers. Hands-on and virtual instructional modules will be developed to explain rheometry/rheology concepts and applications to undergraduate students in engineering courses, underrepresented minority summer camps, high school students, and summer undergraduate researchers. Public outreach videos and podcasts will also be made available to the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery YouTube channel, directly educating K-12 children about the role of rheology in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe rheometer system with custom measurement suites will provide access to state-of-the-art measurement resolution, extreme environmental control, and an unprecedented diversity of measurement capabilities. The instrument will be used to advance research in three core areas. 1) Dense and dispersed particle systems: The high-temperature shear cell and environmental chamber will lead to experimental characterization of the relative impact of inter-particle frictional, collisional, and agglomeration of ceramic and metallic powders for temperatures up to 1000 \u00b0C, operating conditions of interest for both additive manufacturing feedstocks and thermochemical energy storage media. 2a) Complex fluids: Magnetorheology, microscopy, interfacial rheology, and Raman spectroscopy modules will allow in-situ experimental studies and characterization of rheo-structural complex fluid properties such as polymer gels or emulsions. 2b) Soft materials: The custom dynamic mechanical analysis module will enable a fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of self-healing, photo-curable elastomers for additive manufacturing over a previously unattainable range of loading conditions, strain rates, temperatures, and humidities. 3) Tribology measurement and analysis: The tribology and Raman suites will support the in-situ observation of material transfer and tribo-chemical conversions, leading to the discovery of new interfacial sliding mechanisms used to design novel quiet drones and hypersonic systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
