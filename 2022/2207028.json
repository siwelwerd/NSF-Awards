The meeting will be held in hybrid format (in-person and online) and will provide a workshop for graduate students and early-career postdocs on Pandemic Scenario Modeling and Science Communication. In this workshop, participants will learn the latest applications of models to study outbreak scenarios, and further incorporate economics and host behavior into these models to determine the impacts of social aspects on infectious disease transmission. Moreover, trainees will obtain training in effective science communication. Conference sessions will include these same themes, and additionally address the importance of Social Justice and Infectious Disease. A final session will focus on Infectious Diseases Across Scales, with a focus on understanding how interactions between biological, spatial and\r\ntemporal scales affect transmission of pathogens and parasites of a wide diversity of hosts, including wildlife, livestock and humans. The meeting will bring together scientists from around the world to discuss the latest research on pressing issues, including the role of climate change in driving infectious disease, and the importance of racial and other social disparities in causing inequity and preventing effective control of disease. The explicit focus on social justice and infectious disease will showcase the crucial integration of biomedical science, social science, public health and ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
