 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will fund the Canada-Mexico-USA Conference in Representation Theory, Noncommutative Algebra, and Categorification that will take place in Northeastern University, Boston in June 2022. Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies symmetries of physical theories and of mathematical objects. Often the main objects in representation theory are only the shadow of richer structures that are recovered through deeper study. Noncommutative algebra is a related branch of mathematics that studies deformations of commutative objects found in quantum theories, representation theory, and geometry. The foci of the conference will be on recent advances at the interface of representation theory and noncommutative algebra; on fostering an environment for the establishment of international collaborations between Canada, Mexico, and the USA in these research areas; and on exposing graduate students, post-docs, and early-career faculty in the three countries to current developments in the field. A poster session will run through the full meeting where earlier-career attendees will present their research.\r\n\r\nThe main scientific topics for the fourth meeting in this series of Canada-Mexico-USA conferences will be geometric, algebraic, and homological methods in representation theory, representation theoretic and homological properties of noncommutative algebras, and the investigation of those problems using categorical methods. The talks will cover some of the most recent trends including: cluster algebras, monoidal and additive categorifications, quantum symmetries, finite tensor categories, representations of quantized affine Kac-Moody algebras, Calabi-Yau algebras and triangulated categories, Hopfological algebra, web approaches to modular representation theory, and representation theoretic aspects of Heegaard-Floer homology.  For more information on the conference, see https://yakimov.sites.northeastern.edu/can-mex-us-conf-2022/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
