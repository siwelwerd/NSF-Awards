The selected students will attend the conference and present a poster or presentation. Students will benefit from the technical experience and professional networking in both formal and informal settings. Consideration in the selection process will be given to the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups, diversity of institutions that the students represent, and diversity of programs within engineering. This opportunity will have societal and economic impact of the field of mechanics of materials, and in developing the next generation of researchers and engineers from diverse backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe SES Annual Technical Meetings are a leading forum for bringing together diverse, interdisciplinary groups of researchers to discuss advances in highly focused symposia. In 2022, the conference will have approximately eighty symposia within multiple technical thematic areas that include solids and structures, soft and flexible, biomechanics and mechanobiology, data science and machine learning, fluid and granular, manufacturing and infrastructure, multifunctional and multifield, and robotics and controls. The opportunity to attend and present will broaden the participating students\u2019 technical understanding, stimulate the development of new ideas and research topics, and provide numerous professional development and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
