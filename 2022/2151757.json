 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a radio frequency (RF) network miniaturization technology and manufacturing methodologies to dramatically reduce the size, weight, and cost of RF filters. This research will develop special filters for a broad range of wireless applications, including smartphones and their infrastructure, WiFi devices, broadcast systems, and satellite systems. The proposed technology may reduce landfill contributions by over 300 tons, scrap metal by 2200 tons, and general metal consumption by 4500 tons.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of the world\u2019s first RF filter network miniaturization in air using an new network fractionalization algorithm via simulation and prototype fabrication. The fractionalization algorithm overcomes the high challenging wavelength barrier to RF filter miniaturization in air for development of miniature multilayer air filter structures. This project will develop: (1) methods of manufacture for single resonator circuit layer assemblies, the main building blocks for construction of multilayer air filter structures; (2) manufacturing methodologies for structures comprising multiple single resonator circuit layer assemblies to fabricate multi-resonator miniature multilayer air filter prototypes to demonstrate performance and key attributes of the multilayer air filter technology at various frequencies and power levels. The prototypes will be used to demonstrate the scalability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the miniature multilayer air filters for mass volume production, as well as to establish production unit cost models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
