 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) Sciences. This program will engage students in exploration of economic, environmental, and infrastructure challenges in Dallas, Texas, using publicly available data sources. The eight-week program will begin with a three-week period of lectures in social science theory and research methods, including place-based economics, data collection methodologies and sources, and data ethics. Simultaneous technical workshops will equip students with skills in coding, data wrangling, and use of mapping software. Each participant will then join a research team focused on measuring variability or mitigating disparities across urban neighborhoods. The objectives of the REU site are to provide students with expertise in data science methods and tools for studying problems affecting small geographies;  to increase interest in data science and the likelihood that participating students will pursue graduate studies in a related field, especially for students underrepresented in these fields; to engage students in research that requires interdisciplinary skills and knowledge; and to increase collaboration across disciplinary boundaries for both faculty and students, and between university researchers and community partners.\r\n\r\nExamples of research team topics are: (a) assessing the fairness of county polling place locations; (b) describing the change in urban heat island locations and intensity over time, as well as its proximity to neighborhoods; (c) evaluating economic development, workforce development, and affordable housing interventions in small urban areas; and (d) educating and empowering neighborhoods near toxic chemical waste sites using data-driven findings. To address its questions, each team will use specialized methodologies and tools, which the students will be exposed to under the supervision of their mentoring faculty and graduate student team. The methodologies will vary by problem, but collectively include causal inference, complex survey design and analysis, clustering and prediction, data visualization and storytelling, and human-centered design.  The research findings will be shared in a university-wide three-minute thesis contest for all summer undergraduate researchers, and an opportunity to publish a paper in the universities Journal of Undergraduate Research. Besides the participants\u2019 direct contribution to these studies, the data products they produce by retrieving, wrangling, and curating the public data will make a valuable contribution to a collective data resource about Dallas, which can be shared with local researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Supported by the National Science Foundation, the program combined rigorous academic training with real-world applications, allowing undergraduates&mdash;especially those from institutions with limited research opportunities in data science &mdash; to contribute meaningfully to urgent social challenges in Dallas.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research-Intensive, Student-Centered Learning</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each summer from 2022 through 2024, cohorts of 9&ndash;12 students from across the country participated in an 8-week immersive research experience on the Dallas campus of SMU. The first two weeks featured an intensive &ldquo;bootcamp&rdquo; in Python programming, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), data science principles, use of SMU&rsquo;s high performance computing facilities, and quantitative social science methods. Designed by expert faculty, this training introduced students to tools and methodologies typically reserved for graduate-level study.</p>\r\n<p>In the remaining six weeks, students worked in teams with SMU faculty on data-driven research projects with application to eviction patterns, urban farming, housing affordability, economic development in &ldquo;liminal&rdquo; cities, and human trafficking. These projects were not only academically rigorous but also community-engaged. Students partnered with local organizations and visited sites such as eviction courts, urban farms, the George W Bush Museum and Institute, and Dallas City Hall, to ground their research in real-world context.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Advancing Knowledge Through Applied Research</strong></p>\r\n<p>The intellectual merit of the program is evident in the originality and impact of the students' research. For example, the 2022 team studying polling place fairness developed a novel spatial framework for assessing voting access that drew the attention of local officials and academics. A SMU mathematics professor recognized the methodology's relevance to evaluating gerrymandering severity, leading to discussions with Dallas County officials and a proposal for federal funding to build a community data platform.</p>\r\n<p>In 2023, the economics team developed a method to identify high-potential zones for economic growth in various cities, which their faculty mentor is preparing for publication. Data from the eviction research team contributed to legislative efforts to advocate for tenant rights. Another team&rsquo;s findings on urban farming were included in a dissertation on science education and shared with local nonprofits to support grant applications.</p>\r\n<p>All participants presented their work at public forums and academic venues, including the University of Texas Southwestern, the Southern Demographic Association, and the Bush Institute. Students also competed in a 24-hour hackathon and a 3-Minute Thesis competition, sharpening their ability to communicate complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Measurable Impact on Student Development</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many REU participants came from institutions without robust data science offerings, fulfilling the program&rsquo;s mission to expand access to research and to aid in workforce development for data science careers.</p>\r\n<p>A post-program survey from the 2022 cohort showed that 89% of students felt the REU had positively influenced their post-graduate plans, with four pursuing graduate school and four beginning analyst careers. Pre- and post-assessments indicated a 20% increase in technical and career-related skills and a 17% improvement in creative thinking. In 2023, 90% said they were more interested in earning a PhD, and in 2024, 75% said the program helped shape or confirm their career goals. Student comments consistently highlighted how the program expanded their career possibilities and deepened their understanding of how data science can be used for social good.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Building Interdisciplinary Research Capacity</strong></p>\r\n<p>Faculty from economics, civil and biomedical engineering, statistics and data science, law, and education formed research clusters inspired by REU projects, which secured additional internal funding. These teams continued research on equitable development, transportation logistics related to eviction, and spatial disparities in public service access.</p>\r\n<p>The program also initiated long-term partnerships with community-based organizations and local government. Findings from REU projects were integrated into a white paper evaluating the Dallas Collaborative for Equitable Development and supported advocacy, grant writing, and policy development. In 2023, a new collaboration with the Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation enabled public health interns to join REU activities and present their work at UT Southwestern Medical Center.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Sustainable Model for Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p>The program&rsquo;s success is clear: growing application numbers (from 39 in 2022 to 165 in 2024), high student satisfaction, multiple conference presentations, and ongoing scholarly outputs. The REU program at SMU demonstrated how undergraduate research can be both intellectually rigorous and socially meaningful. It showed that with the right structure&mdash;intensive training, committed mentorship, and strong community partnerships&mdash;undergraduates can contribute to high-quality research with real-world impact. It also built institutional capacity within the SMU Office of Engaged Learning to support future REUs, with strong infrastructure, evaluation tools, and interdisciplinary networks now in place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/10/2025<br>\nModified by: Monnie&nbsp;McGee</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744298551027_M2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744298551027_M2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tour of Maneframe III Facilities at SMU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744298551027_M2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tour of Maneframe III Facilities at SMU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU participants toured the facility housing SMU's high performance computing center, ManeFrame 3.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelly Chandrapal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monnie&nbsp;McGee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tour of Maneframe III Facilities at SMU</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744297749748_Homeland_Security_visit_2__1_--rgov-214x142.JPEG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744297749748_Homeland_Security_visit_2__1_--rgov-800width.JPEG\" title=\"REU Participants in front of the Homeland Security Investigations Office in Dallas, Texas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744297749748_Homeland_Security_visit_2__1_--rgov-66x44.JPEG\" alt=\"REU Participants in front of the Homeland Security Investigations Office in Dallas, Texas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU participants visited the Homeland Security Investigations Office in Dallas, Texas, to learn about HSI and Dallas Police Department joint efforts to investigate and prosecute instances of human trafficking in North Texas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelly Chandrapal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monnie&nbsp;McGee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU Participants in front of the Homeland Security Investigations Office in Dallas, Texas</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744298390770_Joppy_Momma_s_Farm_2__1_--rgov-214x142.JPEG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744298390770_Joppy_Momma_s_Farm_2__1_--rgov-800width.JPEG\" title=\"REU Participants working at Joppy Mama's Urban Farm\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2150505/2150505_10794555_1744298390770_Joppy_Momma_s_Farm_2__1_--rgov-66x44.JPEG\" alt=\"REU Participants working at Joppy Mama's Urban Farm\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU participants aided workers a Joppy Mama's Urban Farm in weeding and planting fruits and vegetables.
