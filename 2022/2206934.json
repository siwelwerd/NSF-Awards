The conference themes are theory, modeling, and applications of Bayesian statistics. The focus of this award is on funding for junior researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) from U.S.-based institutions to travel to the conference. Emphasis will be placed on supporting women and members of underrepresented groups. Participating in the conference will inform junior statisticians about key problems and methods that shape research in modern Bayesian statistics and provide them with opportunities to learn from more established researchers and to build mentoring and collaborative relationships. More information on the conference is available on the meeting web page: https://isbawebmaster.github.io/ISBA2022/\r\n\r\nStatisticians play an indispensable role in making decisions based on noisy, complex data structures. Statistical methods find application in myriad areas, including biomedical research, environmental science, finance, marketing, psychology, public health, and genomics. Within statistics, the Bayesian approach offers many appealing features: Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework for integrating information from different sources and communicating findings and conclusions using probabilities; Bayesian hierarchical models can capture different sources of variability in data and processes; relevant knowledge can be incorporated easily; and all relevant uncertainties are coherently propagated and incorporated into the final inference. Consequently, Bayesian analyses are commonplace across a wide variety of application areas. ISBA 2022 will bring together a diverse international community of researchers and practitioners who develop and use Bayesian statistical methods to share recent findings, exchange ideas, and discuss new, challenging questions. As a truly international meeting, it will provide participants with access to ideas and colleagues from other countries with whom they may not ordinarily interact. Meeting organizers hope to provide a venue that facilitates the exchange of ideas and cross-fertilization, is welcoming to young researchers, and promotes collaborations and interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
