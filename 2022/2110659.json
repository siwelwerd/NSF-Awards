 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a novel battery design which rapidly deactivates in contact with aqueous environments. Every year, tens of thousands of children suffer as a result of ingesting coin cell batteries. These children may needlessly suffer debilitating and sometimes fatal consequences. Exposure to unforeseen battery ingestions increases with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IOT) and wearable devices that use compact, high energy density, batteries replaceable by the consumer. Such batteries are increasingly required to have higher potential or capacity (or both) and pose an ever-greater risk to unsuspecting children. Worldwide, 10 billion coin cell batteries are sold annually and this is one of the fastest growing, highest margin consumer battery segments. These sales are expected to translate to nearly $2 billion in the lithium battery primary market by 2024. Consumer use of coin cells is growing; By 2030, 125 billion IOT devices are expected to be sold globally many powered by coin cells. The magnitude of the  potential child-ingestion problem is significant. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR phase I project seeks to reduce children's injuries caused by injesting coin cell batteries by using a novel material design to rapidly deactivate coin cell batteries when they come into contact with aqueous environments. The research addresses the fundamental issue of electrochemical burns. The solution will conform to established standards for coin cell batteries in terms of electrical and other performance requirements. Phase I research efforts will include identifying suitable materials for specific component(s) of a coin cell battery, demonstrating that novel material combinations can be manufactured using scalable process, and producing hand-assembled lithium primary coin cell batteries that have an appropriate open circuit potential and electrical discharge characteristics under continuous ohmic load and pulsed discharge conditions.  The teams also seeks to demonstrate that fully-assembled cells deactivate rapidly when the cells come into contact with aqueous environments. The tests include the use of highly sensitive source measure unit(s) to apply potential and detect current in aqueous environments. Additionally, material robustness will be tested for electrical, mechanical, and processability parameters.  Electrical discharge and battery performance testing procedures will be used in accordance with current standards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
