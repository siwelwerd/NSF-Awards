 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulent flow plays a crucial role in health and engineering across a range of important issues, from climate to aviation and cardiovascular disease. A better understanding of turbulence is thus central to human health and the sustainability of natural resources. The most essential features of turbulence are its chaotic and multiscale natures, posing both challenges and opportunities. To address this challenge, the principal aim of this project is to provide a new theoretical and computational research avenue that uses a deterministic framework to unravel predictable and multiscale characteristics in turbulence for flow control. In addition to providing the fundamental knowledge necessary to advance energy-saving flow-control strategies, this project will also provide the perfect educational platform to promote practical workforce training in academia as the real-world importance of turbulence and flow control will excite students at various levels. To this end, industry-relevant projects will be developed to cultivate a highly qualified industrial workforce by bridging the gap between academic work and industrial problems.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to apply recent advances in the dynamical systems viewpoint of turbulence to solve the problem of the chaotic and multiscale nature embedded in turbulence for rigorous flow control. The key idea is to uncover the predictability and multiscale interactions in turbulence using so-called exact coherent solutions to the governing Navier-Stokes equations. The new knowledge obtained will be exploited for cost-effective turbulence control. In pursuit of this goal, the specific objectives are: (i) identify the predictive dynamics using small-scale exact coherent solutions and (ii) characterize the multiscale interactions between small-scale and large-scale exact coherent solutions and exploit them for flow control. Direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation will be employed to simulate and analyze small-scale and large-scale exact coherent solutions, respectively, along with a suite of analysis tools, including linear instability analysis and resolvent analysis. The discovery that predictive and multiscale dynamics exist will lead to a more rigorous control strategy that can steer turbulence toward desirable states, whereby targeted larger scales are controlled by controlling smaller ones. As energy losses in various industrial flow systems are largely associated with turbulent drag, this project has far-reaching implications in effectively improving the energy efficiency of the systems by taking full advantage of the predictive and multiscale dynamics in turbulence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
