 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operator algebras arose as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics and today is a highly active research area. The Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) will provide early-career graduate students with an introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator algebras. In addition, GOALS aims to increase, in this field, the participation and retention of persons from traditionally underrepresented groups by removing technical barriers to the field and building a strong community of support among the participants, contributors, and organizers. \r\n \r\nOperator algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as topology, group theory, conformal field theory, probability, and logic, to name a few.  As this list indicates, the breadth of knowledge required to actively engage in operator algebras can be intimidating; hence the need for GOALS as stated above. The objectives of GOALS will be accomplished via lecture series on the basics of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; problem sessions; evening discussions on psychological barriers; expository talks about more advanced topics; and a culminating conference with leading researchers in operator algebras.  The community created at GOALS 2022 will be sustained by providing financial support for the participants to reunite at major annual operator algebras conferences such as the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium in May 2023. More details about GOALS are available at https://users.math.msu.edu/users/banelson/conferences/GOALS.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
