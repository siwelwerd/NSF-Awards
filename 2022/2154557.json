 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for U.S.-based participants, including members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences, to participate in the conference \"Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras (YMC*A)\", held August 8-12, 2022 at the University of Oslo, Norway. This meeting is organized for and by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in operator algebras and related areas, with the goal of fostering scientific and social interaction between early-career researchers. In each of its previous six editions, YMC*A has provided an excellent opportunity for over one hundred early-career operator algebraists from around the world to attend mini-courses on current research topics in operator algebras. Networking opportunities at the 2022 edition of the conference are supported by a panel discussion, open to all participants, which covers career advice and issues of equity and by informal mathematical discussions throughout the duration of the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on recent developments in operator algebras, noncommutative geometry, and related areas of mathematical analysis, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between operator algebras and the fields of K-theory, harmonic analysis, and quantization. The conference features three mini-courses by established researchers alongside many contributed talks by participants, and mentoring activities designed to increase retention of underrepresented groups in operator algebras. More information about the conference is available at: https://ymcstara.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
