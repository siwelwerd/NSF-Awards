 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to make orbital maneuvers affordable for large and small CubeSat operators. The proposed technology seeks to supply the market with an affordable, \u201cgreen\u201d, reliable, and easy to integrate modular propulsion system. Minimal integration requirements will allow CubeSat operators to focus on mission objectives and payload first,  instead of the propulsion system integration. Today, integrating a propulsion system requires significant accommodations for thermal, electrical, and volume requirements and hazardous propellants limit available launch service.  Both of these factors contribute to increasing cost and lenthening schedules. The goal of this project is to make advanced maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, rapid end of life disposal, and accurate course corrections accessible capabilities for CubeSats. Accessible propulsion may also reduce orbital congestion as fewer maneuverable satellites can equal the capability of many statically-positioned satellites. CubeSats have already enabled rapid deployment of capabilities including low latency communication relays, defense purposes, and scientific research ranging from fundamental physics experiments to Earth observation. The proposed technology seeks to enhance CubeSat capabilities, opening new industries and discoveries for the next great generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the technology and produce a prototype spaceflight-ready design for a commercially-available, chemical-hybrid propulsion system. Conventional hybrid systems have shown significant downsides due to complex manufacturing, single use and/or toxic ignition systems, and low fuel regression rates. This technology seeks to solve these issues by utilizing a 3-D printed thermoplastic as the base fuel, which has electrical properties that allow for repeatable, rapid, and low power ignition. Some potential propellant combinations have a high theoretical performance, but are incompatible with the ignition method, have a low fuel regression rate, or are difficult to manufacture. After testing propellant combinations for compatibility with the ignition system, the system performance will be simulated. The performance data will be used to evaluate and design a prototype propulsion module. The fuel will be exposed to a simulated space environment and a lab weight scale test will be performed to verify the simulation results. The proposed research plan will identify the best option to produce a competitive and reliable integrated CubeSat propulsion system, with a test campaign constructed to provide confidence that a prototype system will perform as designed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Spacecraft as small as 25 kg now offer the sensing and computational capability of a spacecraft weighing more than several hundred kilograms from just a generation ago. As a result, global interests in very small spacecraft (SmallSats) have grown dramatically, and a competitive commercial market has emerged during the last decade.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, SmallSat technology development has primarily centered on spacecraft bus design and miniaturization of sensor components. Generally, the propulsion industry has not kept pace with the bus avionics growth trend. Only a few space propulsion options are available to the systems designer. As the state-of-the art currently stands, only Hydrazine-based propulsion systems offer a high technology-readiness Level (TRL) Solution. This lack of options is insufficient to support the emerging growth demands of the \"new-space? economy.</p>\n<p>Hydrazine is an effective and reliable monopropellant, and been under development since the late 1950's. Unfortunately, hydrazine-based systems bring a wide range of objective and environmental hazard issues. Hydrazine is a highly toxic and dangerously unstable substance. Hydrazine is a known carcinogen. Hydrazine possesses a high vapor pressure and boils readily at room temperature. Thus, there exists significant risk of respiratory contamination, and special servicing procedures that employ full-pressure self-contained atmospheric protective ensemble suits are required. The toxicity and explosion potential of hydrazine requires extreme handling precautions.</p>\n<p>With a growing regulatory burden, the associated infrastructure requirements for hydrazine transport, storage, servicing, and clean up resulting from accidental releases are rapidly making the use of hydrazine cost prohibitive. A recent study by the European Space Agency Space Research and Technology Center (ESTEC), identified \"reduced production, operational, and transport costs associated with lower propellant toxicity/explosion hazards...,\" as an essential operations change required for achieving low-cost commercial space access developing a non-toxic, stable ?green? alternative for hydrazine was highly recommended.</p>\n<p>The cost associated with hydrazine has led to many small satellites launching with no propulsion: often restricting the capability of the mission. In support of the SmallSat market demands, the hybrid propulsion system discussed in this paper aims to address two key issues in filling the technology gap shown in Figure 1, handling safety and the prohibitive cost requirement that often impeded SmallSat developers from incorporating propulsion into their design.</p>\n<p>In response to this recommendation, this work has investigated the use of hybrid rocket systems as a high-performance, low cost, safe, and \"green\" replacement for Hydrazine. Hybrid rockets are ?safe? due to the relative stability of both the oxidizer and fuel components. This stability comes at a price, as traditionally hybrid rocket systems require a significant energy input for reliable ignition. For the vast majority of hybrid rocket-systems developed to date, pyrotechnic charges are used to ignite a secondary solid-propellant motor whose high-enthalpy output provides sufficient heat to overcome the activation energy of the propellants. This pyrotechnic approach allows only a single-shot ignition, with no inherent restart capability. Thus, this technology gap has limited the full potential for hybrid systems as restartable upper stages or in-space maneuvering systems.</p>\n<p>The hybrid restart issue has been overcome by leveraging the unique electrical breakdown properties of certain 3-D printed thermoplastics like ABS or polyamide. When printed using a technique known as fused deposition manufacturing (FDM), ABS possesses unique electrical breakdown properties that can be exploited to allow for rapid on-demand ignition. Figure 2 shows a typical pyrolysis event, where the ablated hydrocarbon vapor results from the inductive arc carving a path across the fuel surface. Because Joule heating pyrolizes a small mass of fuel material, when an oxidizing flow is introduced. This concept has been developed into a power-efficient system that can be started and restarted with a high degree of rel<strong>i</strong>ability.</p>\n<p>The developed High-Performance ?Green? Hybrid Propulsion (HPGHP) system as an environmentally sustainable replacement for hydrazine and other highly-toxic propellants. In its most mature form, the HPGHP system uses gaseous oxygen (GOX) as the oxidizer with 3-D printed acrylonitrile?butadiene?styrene (ABS) as the fuel. The GOX/ABS propellants are highly mass efficient system, with a prototype light-weight 25 N thrust chamber , shown by Figure 3, achieving a vacuum specific impulse (Isp) greater than 300 s. As shown by Figure 4, various ground-test units with thrust levels varying from 4.5 N to 900 N have been developed and tested. HPGHP systems have been successfully been tested with alternative, higher density \"green\" oxidizers, nitrous oxide and hydrogen peroxide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adam&nbsp;Irvine</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799236203_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799236203_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799236203_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Inductive Charge Pyrolyzing 3-D Printed Acrylonitrile\ufffdButadiene\ufffdStyrene (ABS) Fuel</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Utah State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;Irvine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799337837_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799337837_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799337837_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3-D Printed Fuel Grain With Electrodes25N Thruster Systems Test-Firing</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Utah State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;Irvine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799390517_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799390517_Figure_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799390517_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mass-Produced and Scaled 3-D Printed HPGHP Fuel Grains.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Utah State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;Irvine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799455001_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799455001_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2127098/2127098_10824405_1698799455001_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Current SmallSat Propulsion Systems Trade Space</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Utah State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;Irvine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
