 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop \"Women in Scientific Computing on Complex Physical and Biological Systems'' will be held on the campus of the University of Florida (UF) in Gainesville, FL from Monday October 24 to Wednesday October 26, 2022. The workshop will bring together leading experts from various areas of computational mathematics, life science, computer science, and engineering to vigorously discuss recent developments in scientific computing on complex physical and biological systems with applications to climate change, clean energy, and biotechnology as well as to advance the state-of-the-art  developments in these rapidly developing fields. The workshop will provide a cross-disciplinary forum for catalyzing the research in scientific computing on complex physical and biological systems, facilitating rapid diffusion of new mathematical and computational methods into life science, computer science, and engineering,  and stimulating more researchers to work in these important areas. The workshop will consist of presentations, posters, panel discussions, group discussions and tutorial sessions which will stimulate an intensive exchange of ideas, foster fruitful interactions, identify challenges, promote interdisciplinary collaborations and initiate joint research projects. This award supports the attendance of both researchers and graduate students, with priorities given to female researchers, graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, early career researchers, minority researchers and researchers who do not have other federal support. \r\n \r\nScientific computing is a combination of computing tools, techniques, and theories to solve mathematical models arising from real applications in science and engineering with the help of a computer.  Computational mathematics is not only the application of mathematics for solving challenging real-world problems but also the discovery of new mathematical theories originating from such applications. Mathematical modeling and simulations form a predictive methodology that supplements real experiments as indispensable power for new discoveries. Simulation performance relies not only on computational power but also on the algorithm efficiency and reliability for the underlying complex systems modeled by PDEs. Designing robust and efficient algorithms is crucial for characterizing many phenomena in science and engineering. Life science is an intellectually rich field that has been advanced remarkably through a synergistic interplay between the deep understanding of biology and mathematics. However, biologists are overwhelmed by the amount of experimental data. New methods for data-management and quantitative theories are needed to interpret and contextualize their observations. A variety of challenges in scientific computing related to problems in life science, such as developing predictive models for disorder detection, feature dimensionality reduction, have emerged in recent years. These issues and many other open problems will be discussed among the diverse group of scientists participating in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
