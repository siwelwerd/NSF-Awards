 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Mississippi State University (MSU) to support the acquisition of an 800 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument will support researchers throughout Mississippi and the southeast, enabling new research avenues in biomolecular interactions, organometallic chemistry, and polymeric materials. This project will support a diverse community of researchers at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty at nearby PUIs and HBCUs. Students can access the new instrument firsthand through course offerings at MSU, including \u201cTheory of Solution NMR Spectroscopy.\u201d Moreover, MSU\u2019s \u201cEnvironmental Chemistry\u201d course will feature instrument installation and helium use. A total of 19 investigators, 64 graduate students, 72 undergraduate students, and 7 postdoctoral trainees will be directly and immediately impacted by this project, in addition to other users who benefit through classes and workshops offered at MSU. Many of these trainees will represent ethnic minorities or first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThe new instrument will enable biomolecular and chemical research not currently possible in Mississippi. This is because the new instrument has significantly increased sensitivity and resolution over the current instrumentation available in the region. Biological researchers will use this new NMR spectrometer (1) to explore how microorganisms attach to surfaces, (2) to understand how ion channels are regulated in the heart, (3) to characterize the mechanism of metal-ion-based gene regulation, and (4) to monitor how small molecules respond to changes in metabolism. Chemical researchers will use the instrument to develop new methods for synthesizing polymeric and organometallic materials, and the instrument includes a broadband probe for detecting nonstandard nuclei such as 27Al, 29Si, and 195Pt. Data collected on the new 800 MHz NMR will be shared broadly at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
