 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation project supports the acquisition of an Aerosol Characterization System to be operated by the University of Miami at the Ragged Point in Barbados. The Aerosol Characterization System is expected to open up new research avenues related to the transport of African dust to the Americas, the impact of ocean-derived organic aerosols (OAs) in the marine boundary layer, wildfire smoke, and cloud and radiation processes. This project includes the engagement and training of middle and high school students, University of Miami undergraduate and graduate students, and students from the University of West Indies located in Barbados, as well as students from other collaborating institutions. The new Aerosol Characterization System will enhance the existing infrastructure in an important region of the world.\r\n\r\nThis project includes plans for a broad range of new observations in the Caribbean that can provide significant insight into interdisciplinary science involving the fields of atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, geoscience, meteorology, and public health. The new integrated system of coupled measurement devices will provide in situ characterization of the size, composition, source, and radiative properties of aerosols transported to the Caribbean and North and South America. Observations pertinent to the atmospheric community have been collected at Ragged Point for over 50 years. Twelve new instruments will be acquired and located at the site. A new inlet and observation tower will be constructed. The major components of the proposed Aerosol Characterization System include the new tower and a Quadrupole Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (Q-ACSM), and a Xact 625i ambient metals monitor. An Advisory Committee will be created and will meet biannually to expand the user base and develop a user fee structure for those who wish to conduct research at the site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
