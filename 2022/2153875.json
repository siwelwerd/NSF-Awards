 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of new generation of services and applications in future networks set out many challenging requirements such as high reliability of wireless links, high data rates and support for a large number of users. These challenges become more critical as we move to millimeter wave (mmWave) bands in the quest for very high data rates. While mmWave communication is a major technology for future generations of wireless systems, it suffers from severe signal blockage, attenuation, and mmWave channels easily become time-varying with small movements. These significantly limit the link reliability and communication performance of such systems. To tackle these challenges, this project develops an innovative Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided system for mm-Wave communication, termed as Smart Radio Environments with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces -- Communications through Blockage in Millimeter wave Systems (REFLECT-MMWAVE).\r\n\r\nThe proposed project develops new technologies and methodologies to build smart radio environments that utilize RIS to manipulate the propagation of incident electromagnetic waves in a programmable manner to actively alter the channel realization. This turns the wireless channel into a controllable system block that can be optimized to improve overall system performance. The novel and innovative aspects of this proposal include: (i) Implementation of a modular RIS radio hardware that can achieve the best phase control performance for unit cells of RIS at mm-Wave frequencies. (ii) Development of advanced signal processing algorithms for practical RIS-aided mmWave transceivers, (iii) Machine learning enhanced beamforming and RIS phase shift design. (iv) Optimal design of distributed multiple access control (MAC) for mmWave RIS-aided communication networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
