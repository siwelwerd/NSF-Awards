 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of a novel tubular proton exchange fuel cell and potential commercialization for applications ranging from portable electronics to transport applications. Fuel cells are expected to play a significant role in zero-emission power generation and in the expansion of the hydrogen industry and clean energy, with the global market size projected to reach $25.5 billion by 2024. However, current planar fuel cell designs have challenges before they can be compatible with the Department of Energy targets for specific power, performance, cost, and durability. The proposed technology may address a number of these challenges due to its novel tubular design.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the potential development of a proposed tubular proton exchange fuel cell, which due to its novel design, could offer reduced weight and improved specific power as well as reduced complexity, and reduced cost compared to the conventional planar fuel cell design. The technology may also offer improved reactant mass transport, possibly improved efficient product water removal, and may possess improved uniform reactant, current and temperature distribution. In this technology, structure-property-performance-degradation correlations for conventional, planar, agglomerate-type fuel cells, as well as carbon nanofiber-based fuel cells, could also be established to help guide the future rational design of efficient and stable components for zero-emission systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
