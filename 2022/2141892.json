 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nSome groups of animals have been spectacularly successful at moving among major habitats during their evolution, while other groups have diversified only within single habitats. However, the causes of these transitions remain poorly known, especially when animals use novel strategies that do not follow expectations that seem logical from their anatomy. By using new 3D technology to nondestructively visualize the bones and sensory systems of preserved specimens in natural history collections, this project will create a unified framework for understanding the relative importance of different anatomical traits that facilitate shifts to new habitats. These insights are especially important when organismal systems work together in a way that is more than the simple sum of their parts. The project then uses a student-centered ambassador model (\u201cProject: MORPH!\u201d) to leverage research products into 3D biodiversity education resources and experiences for the public and students at all levels. These components broaden participation in science through outreach programs and exhibits in a natural history museum that serves the Detroit metropolitan area, facilitating 1) experiential learning opportunities with innovative 3D technology and 2) the role of community scientists in providing foundational biodiversity data (\u201cStory of the Specimen\u201d). Additionally, this work provides advanced training in \u201cbig data\u201d analysis and science communication to prepare early-career scientists from diverse backgrounds for future research in biodiversity science. Together, this project provides powerful insight into the drivers of successful invasion of major habitats across an iconic group of vertebrates and leverages emerging technologies towards comprehensive integration of biodiversity research and teaching in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nThis project uses phylogenetic comparative methods to test how sensory systems have integrated with each other, and with trophic and skeletal innovation, to facilitate ecological diversification in snakes.  Using non-invasive computed tomography (CT) scanning of soft tissue in museum specimens, this project tests a set of hypotheses for diversification across at least 60 independent invasions of subterranean, arboreal, and aquatic habitats. These tests are particularly important for understanding the processes underlying evolutionary convergence. Furthermore, tests of sensory evolution will fundamentally advance how classic locomotor and trophic traits are contextualized across ecological diversification in a major vertebrate radiation. Additionally, the educational components offer assessment-driven use of digital specimens that will provide innovative pedagogical insights about and uses of natural history collections, especially for future remote or informal learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
