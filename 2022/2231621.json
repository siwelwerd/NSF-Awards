 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic wounds with associated infections affect approximately 2% of the United States population, primarily in the elderly, bedridden, and patients with diabetes, and place severe physical and financial strain on those affected and the broader healthcare system. There remains an urgent need for novel strategies that enable the point-of-care monitoring of wounds to diagnose the degree of progression or healing of the wound in addition to identifying the type and severity of pathogenic infections. This EAGER award will fund a research program that will create a new optically active bandage with integrated nanosensors that detect several indicators (biomarkers) of wounds simultaneously. The bandage sensing system is inherently wireless and does not require a power source or sensitive electronics to be worn. This research will generate new knowledge, as the interactions between the nanosensors and the biomarkers will be explored in addition to the parameters of the textile synthesis process. The resulting changes in the optical signals from the textile will be correlated to biomarker concentrations. This research will be incorporated into an existing \u201cnano-bio\u201d outreach program that the PI runs at a local high school. Finally, this platform technology can be modified to develop wearable sensors for other important applications, e.g. sensing disease biomarkers in the sweat.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this EAGER project is to create, optimize and explore the in vitro functionality of a smart wound dressing platform for the real-time and multiplexed monitoring of wound biomarkers of infection. It is known that the presence of pathogenic bacterial biofilms can significantly prolong the healing process; however, the in situ detection and subsequent treatment of such infections is often difficult. Thus, there is an urgent need for a point-of-care wound monitoring platform that could help to decrease the liabilities associated with prolonged hospitalizations and lab testing by detecting infections in real-time and in an in situ fashion, i.e. without the need to remove the bandage. Based upon promising preliminary data obtained in the PI\u2019s laboratory, a novel microfibrous platform is proposed for the multiplexed detection of relevant wound biomarkers of chronicity and infection. The combined analyte detection and signal transduction element is an array of fluorescent carbon nanotube sensors with engineered selectivity and sensitivity to biomarkers of chronic wounds including hydrogen peroxide, interleukin-6 cytokine, and pyocyanin toxin. Embedded within a biocompatible gauze-like microfibrous platform, in situ detection of the wound biomarkers is accomplished wirelessly (optically) with a hand-held near-infrared spectrometer device.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
