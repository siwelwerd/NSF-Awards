 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Rhode Island\u2019s (URI) Graduate School for Oceanography (GSO), located in Narragansett, RI, will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site program. The program, called Summer Undergraduate Research For Oceanography (SURFO), will bring ten to twelve undergraduates to the GSO campus each summer for a ten-week internship. SURFO research experiences are designed for science, math and engineering students who will have completed their junior year of studies. \r\n\r\nGSO has extensive research facilities and many mentors who are available to support undergraduate research projects. SURFO interns use their quantitative STEM background in projects, for example, involving fluid dynamics and transport, biogeochemical transformations, ecology and diversity, autonomous platforms and exploration and discovery. A SURFO's research may include, but is not limited to, laboratory work, field work, data analysis, instrument development, and model simulations of the ocean realm. SURFO students develop an individual research topic under the mentorship of a URI faculty member, Marine Research Scientist or Post-Doctoral Fellow and carry out a program of research from the proposal-stage, to conduct and analysis, and concluding with the dissemination of their results in an oral presentation and a written document. The written document is in either journal manuscript or NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Proposal format. Recruiting efforts include continued work with the Puerto Rico - Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), the NorthEast LSAMP, and resources identified by the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society and The Oceanography Society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
