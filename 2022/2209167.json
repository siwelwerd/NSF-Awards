 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei, are comprised of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons, whose interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  This theory suggests that many other types of composite particles, known as hadrons, should exist in Nature as unstable resonances.  The properties of certain hadronic resonances as predicted by QCD will be investigated using large-scale computing resources.  The proposed research lends support to current experiments, such as the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab).  The structure of the nucleon and scattering involving one particular hadron known as a Delta baryon will be another focus.  This scattering information will be crucial for experiments studying neutrinos, an important elementary particle that permeates the universe.  The PI will mentor a graduate student engaged in this research, and the graduate student will also receive training in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources.  \r\n\r\nThe physics of hadron-hadron interactions will be studied using Monte Carlo estimates of path integrals involving quark and gluon fields on a space-time lattice.  Nucleon-pion, nucleon-nucleon, and nucleon-hyperon scattering phase shifts will be computed, yielding important information on hadron structure.  Scattering processes involving nucleon-pion-pion will also be considered.  New computational techniques, such as the stochastic LapH method, have made possible such computations in lattice QCD, which involve estimating temporal  correlation matrices of multi-hadron and excited-state operators.  Form factors involving the nucleon and transitions through the Delta baryon will be a particular focus since they are crucial to accelerated-based neutrino experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
