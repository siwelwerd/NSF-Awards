 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a multi-billion dollar market for low-cost, energy-efficient embedded systems. Unfortunately, as the software for such systems is typically developed in C, they suffer from the same programmer-induced memory errors that have plagued general-purpose systems. Unlike most general-purpose computers, however, exploitation often leads to real-world physical consequences.  This project will develop new methods to secure embedded software. Rather than place the security burden entirely on developers of embedded systems, the objective of this project is to shift the enforcement of fundamental security properties to the compiler, using a combination of compile-time static analysis, runtime instrumentation, and hardware support. The project will also consider compiler enhancements to enable end-developer security customization and promote software longevity.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide a scientific foundation for compiler-assisted security on low-cost embedded systems. Such systems are already widely deployed in existing domains, such as cyber-physical systems, and are increasingly a part of emerging technologies, such as the internet-of-things (IoT). The project will produce open-source software and educational artifacts for both researchers and developers, including compiler enhancements, benchmark applications, and tutorials on the artifacts to be presented at tutorials and conferences. Finally, this project will improve student education outcomes at the participating institutions by integrating the research activities with security competitions for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
