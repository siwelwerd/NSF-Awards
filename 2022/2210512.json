SOCKS is focusing in the topic of Computational Social Sciences which is properly aligned with the Vermont's Science and Technology Plan.  The planning grant proposal offers an optimal opportunity to achieve the goals set forth by Vermont\u2019s State Committee.  A series of workshops in team science and broader impacts including an \"all-hands\" meeting that includes the participation of experts in the area as well as diversity of attendees will serve to explore  ideas for the full proposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
