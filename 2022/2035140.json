 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an energetically-based device to eliminate pathogens safely.\u00a0 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown\u00a0the importance of sanitizing and protecting against viral pathogens known and unknown. The proposed approach of using energy for disruption of viral particles has high potential for sanitization.\u00a0 This electromagnetic approach\u00a0can penetrate walls, thereby offering a method to sanitize hard-to-access building systems, such as HVAC air ducts and air flow systems.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes that an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device can be used as an antiviral\u202fand antibacterial mechanism. \u202f This project proposes\u00a0to develop the world's first software-defined electromagnetic pulse\u00a0into a wireless, \u201csafe for humans\u201d anti-bacterial and anti-viral device.\u00a0 This project will explore the use of varying electromagnetic fields to compromise the viral capsid and inactivate the virus.\u00a0 The project will identify the frequencies effective for pathogen inactivation and then will develop a device to deliver those frequencies.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
