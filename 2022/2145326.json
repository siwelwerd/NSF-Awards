 "awd_abstract_narration": "Melting-based additive manufacturing (AM) has been utilized for high-value metallic component manufacture. Limitations exist, however, due to the high process temperatures, (often beyond the melting point of component materials), and the large associated thermal gradients and rapid cooling rates. On the other hand, non-melting metal AM such as cold spray technology, in which tiny powder particles are accelerated to a supersonic speed to collide, bond to and build up underlying materials upon impact, may considerably alleviate the melting-rooted challenges. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research in developing a fundamental understanding of the process-microstructure-property relationships for cold spray AM using novel high-speed single-particle impact testing, complemented by multi-scale numerical modeling, to study individual bonded particles, the building blocks of the cold spray process, and then expand to a part-level study. The research will enable reliable and performance-oriented processing design for cold spray AM, with a potential to strengthen the Nation\u2019s defense and other industries through enabling sustainable and agile manufacturing and repair at the point of need. The knowledge gained may also be translated to other solid-state joining or additive technologies for aerospace, construction and energy applications. The team will engage K-12 students and educators through hands-on activities with a designed additive manufacturing toolkit. The project will also promote participation from underrepresented minority students in advanced manufacturing through 10-week summer camps in a research laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this CAREER project is to establish a unified framework to understand and predict the critical velocity, impact-induced microstructural development, micro-scale bond strength, and macro-scale mechanical properties of cold-sprayed deposits. Laser-induced micro-scale projectile impact testing will be conducted with high-resolution imaging to produce well-defined high-velocity individual bonded particles, with microstructures and properties characterized by advanced electron microscopy and micro-mechanical measurements. Both the first layer impacts and particle impacts on subsequent layers will be systematically investigated. The role of the impact velocity, oxide layer thickness, particle size and temperature, and impact angle in the characteristics of bonded interfaces and local bond strengths will be scientifically revealed. Further, finite element modeling incorporating a dislocation-based constitutive model, oxide layer fracture, and cohesive bonding will be established, which will be used to predict the impact-induced microstructure changes and bond strengths. The micro-scale simulations will inform a macro-scale model to calculate the mechanical properties of cold-sprayed specimens. Different sources of statistical effects resulting from the distribution of particle sizes, temperatures, and oxide layer thicknesses will also be considered in the multi-scale model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
