 "awd_abstract_narration": "Color centers in diamond are impurities which give color to this otherwise colorless crystal. In addition to jewelry, they are also of scientific importance and have emerged as a promising platform for implementing quantum technologies such as quantum networks, sensors, and computers. We propose to further investigate and develop the tin-vacancy (SnV) color center in diamond, which is particularly promising because of its operation at friendlier temperatures (not requiring dilution refrigerators), high efficiency of photon emission, and ability to act as quantum memory and store quantum information. However, for all of these applications it is critical to embed either individual or several color centers inside of photonic structures, in order to implement interfaces to color centers without degrading them. We propose to do this over the course of this project, and to push the limits of such quantum photonic interfaces and interaction between color centers and light with specially engineered diamond structures, new materials processing, and new design techniques. We will demonstrate the interaction of one or a few color center qubits with an optical resonator over the course of this project, which is a key element of many quantum technologies. The proposed research will impact quantum engineering, fundamental physics, and materials science. The project includes educational and outreach activities integrated with research, which the PI has already initiated, including active recruitment students for science and engineering careers, and undergraduate research and advising. \r\n \r\nTechnical description\r\n \r\nWe propose a 3-year effort focused on developing optically accessible spin qubits with long coherence time, high operation fidelity, efficient light-matter interfaces for long-range interactions, and the potential for high-temperature operation (a few Kelvin, eliminating the need for a dilution refrigerator). We will develop this system based on tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in diamond photonic resonators. The specific research goals are: \r\n\u25cf\tTo investigate novel nano-fabrication methods on diamond substrates that enable controllable, strong coupling of a single SnV and several SnV color centers to the cavity.\r\n\u25cf\tTo demonstrate and to investigate single and multi-emitter cavity QED between SnV emitters and a diamond cavity. The demonstration of the strong coupling regime of light-matter interaction is crucial for numerous quantum technologies, and can be used as a building block for quantum network nodes, quantum sensors, and for scalable photonic or spin based quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
