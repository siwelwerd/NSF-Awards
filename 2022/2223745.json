 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2023, 2024, and 2025 meetings of the Texas Oklahoma Regional Undergraduate Symposium (TORUS) series. The first of these will be held on February 18, 2023, at Dallas College. Subsequent symposia will be held in February 2024 at Southern Nazarene University and February 2025 at Tarleton State University. TORUS is an annual one-day conference that has been held since 2005 at different universities in the Texas and Oklahoma regions. It provides opportunities for undergraduates interested in the study of mathematics to participate in scholarly and social activities in mathematics with other colleges and universities with the goal of encouraging students to pursue graduate study and careers in mathematics. TORUS also helps strengthen connections between undergraduate-focused colleges/universities in the Texas Oklahoma region and encourages faculty at these institutions to pursue research projects with undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nEach symposium includes two invited talks, student presentations, a panel discussion, and Math Jeopardy. Furthermore, students will have the opportunity to share the results of their research (for example, a paper or poster) with a larger audience via the conference website. The conference website is https://www.cameron.edu/math/events/torus\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
