 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study quantum fluctuations of energy density and of gravity and related physical effects. Recent work has shown that the probability of very large energy density fluctuations is much larger than had previously been thought. These energy density fluctuations can also lead to large fluctuations of the gravitational field, which are a type of quantum gravity effect. This project will seek a deeper understanding of these large fluctuations. It will also study similar effects in condensed matter and atomic systems which may be possible to observe in the laboratory. The results of this investigation may have broader impacts on other areas of science, mathematics, and possibly technology. The basic principles and techniques to be explored are expected to have application beyond the specific set of topics to be studied. The project will contribute to education, and to human resource development through the involvement of students. Both graduate and undergraduate students can participate in various aspects of the project, and to improve their skills in scientific analysis and communication. The project will also create examples that will be useful to explain subtle concepts in quantum theory and gravity to students at various educational levels and to the general public.\r\n\r\nA better understanding of large energy density fluctuations and related effects are expected to lead to a deeper understanding both of quantum physics and of gravity. The effects on the gravitational field are quantum gravity effects, and their study can be one of the paths to a more complete quantum theory of gravity. This project will explore quantum fluctuations of nonlinear operators such as the quantum stress energy tensor.  Of particular interest is the possibility of producing primordial black holes in the early universe this way.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
