 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2022 Physics Congress (PhysCon), organized by Sigma Pi Sigma (the physics honor society) and supported by the American Institute of Physics (AIP), is the largest single gathering of physics undergraduate students in the world. This award to AIP supports the attendance to this meeting by members of underrepresented groups in physics. This year\u2019s conference, themed 100 Years of Momentum, will include keynote lectures by renowned scientists; interactive workshops on key topics of importance to undergraduates in the physical sciences; and tours of major science facilities to provide transformative experiences for the students.\r\n\r\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics are both extremely underrepresented in physics. According to 2020 U.S. Census data, 16% of the 20\u201324-year-olds in the U.S. are African American and 22.3% are Hispanic. By comparison, data from the AIP Statistical Research Center shows that just over 3% of physics bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2019 were awarded to African Americans, and 11% to Hispanics in 2019. Thus, both ethnic groups see less than the expected representation among physics undergraduates that should be expected based on the population. This award aims to address the participation and success of underrepresented students in physics by making them aware of resources and building connections to the physics community. This program would have SPS and volunteer leaders work with departments individually to identify students that would benefit from the program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PhysCon hosted over 1300 students, educators, and professionals, and featured 4 plenaries from leaders in physics and astronomy, and 4 special plenary talks celebrating the centennial of &Sigma;&Pi;&Sigma;. Attendees participated in interactive student poster sessions, 16 hands-on workshops, tours of scientific institutions in the DC metro area, and multiple networking events. The funding provided for students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) not only helped break attendance records for the conference, it also ensured that PhysCon was diverse and inclusive of traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>Through this award, 76 students from 3 HBCUs and 10 MSIs were granted travel funding to attend PhysCon 2022. The award included registration, hotels, and transportation (typically airfare) to and from the conference site. Eligible students were identified via targeted outreach to HBCUs and MSIs, including emails, social media postings, phone calls to Physics Department Chairs and Society of Physics Students Chapter Advisors as well as through partnerships with the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP), National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP), and the Society for Advancement of Chicanos / Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>Each student receiving the award presented technical posters during one of the conference-wide poster sessions and were also asked to complete short post-conference reports regarding their experiences. The top themes related to the impact of the award on students' career choices were learning how to communicate their work better through presentations, feeling inspired and motivated to continue working towards graduate school, and networking and looking at potential graduate programs at the graduate school fair. A few testimonials from students attest to this experience:</p>\n<p><em>\"[The] most rewarding part of attending PhysCon was being able to present a poster on my research.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I attended the career expo where I was able to meet with many potential graduate schools.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I was able to connect with many professional within the field of physics and similar fields.\"</em></p>\n<p>These comments indicate that attending the conference not only affirmed and invigorated students but can have tangible outcomes in expanding their networks and access to opportunities for furthering their careers.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>Part of the motivation for this travel award was to provide students who are traditionally under-represented the opportunity to see themselves represented in their field, and to give them the opportunity to engage in a professional conference and network with a broad range of individuals within the physical sciences. The top themes related to the broader societal impact on students were seeing themselves being represented in the physical sciences, meeting personal heroes, and making lifelong memories, as evidenced by the following testimonials from final reports:</p>\n<p><em>\"It was the first time I had seen so many black engineers and physicists in person. So when I got to meet all of them, especially Renee Horton, in person, I was so happy and thought, 'if they could do it, I can too.'\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"PhysCon 2022 was one of the most fruitful and enlightening experiences I have experienced in my life...I recommend this experience to anyone who is interested in Physics, no matter your background or place of origin because the experiences and memories one gains are literally life-changing[.]\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Student Experience</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to affirming career choices and making students feel involved, students also had the opportunity to further explore career options through tours and career panels. Many of the plenary speakers spoke about feelings of burnout and impostor syndrome, which resonated with students feeling this way after spending parts of their undergraduate career studying under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several students mentioned this in their final reports as being uplifting and reassuring:</p>\n<p><em>\"While it was incredible to see all these famous physicists on stage it was reassuring to know that they had struggles as well...the main issues people found with their SPS chapters was burnout and imposter syndrome. I have experienced these, especially these past couple years coming out of the pandemic and it's nice to know that I'm not alone.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"It's easy to feel bogged down and lost as a physics major, usually your home department is small and it is even harder to find people that strive for the same goals as you. The plenary speaker talk left me invigorated and remotivated to study physics. It was amazing to hear Jocelyn Bell's opinion on the field of physics and her experience as a woman in astronomy/physics. Her words truly touched me, there is no other way to describe it.\"</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;M&nbsp;Zeidell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619716922_PANA5183_reduced--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619716922_PANA5183_reduced--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Right Hand Rule\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619716922_PANA5183_reduced--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Right Hand Rule\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PhysCon attendees show off the right hand rule, both a physics mnemonic and the unofficial 'secret' handshake of the Sigma Pi Sigma honor society, in the Omni Shoreham courtyard where PhysCon 2022 was held.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">American Institute of Physics</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;M&nbsp;Zeidell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Right Hand Rule</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619809672_PANA5354_reduced--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619809672_PANA5354_reduced--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PhysCon Tours\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619809672_PANA5354_reduced--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PhysCon Tours\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students return from a tour of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center during the first day of PhysCon.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">American Institute of Physics</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;M&nbsp;Zeidell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PhysCon Tours</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619922676_PANA5428_Reduced--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619922676_PANA5428_Reduced--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Signing the map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2208926/2208926_10796250_1682619922676_PANA5428_Reduced--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Signing the map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A PhysCon attendee signs a map printed on a banner in one of the meeting halls during PhysCon.
