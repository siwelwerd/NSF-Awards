 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Georgia Southern University (GSU) is acquiring single crystal diffractometer equipped with a high-flux Cu X-ray source, a Hybrid Photon Counting (HPC) detector, and a cryogenic device to support the research of Gary Guillet and colleagues Clifford Padgett, Brandon Quillian, and Arpita Saha. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, magnetic materials, and organometallic chemistry. organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and the surrounding region. The facility serves as a regional XRD resource benefitting students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions within the state of Georgia with impacts outside GSU with interactions with PUI and HBCU institutions such as Savannah State University (HBCU), Albany State University (HBCU), University of North Georgia, and Georgia College.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. Research enabled by the instrument is focused on the study and characterization of the structure of novel extended metal atom chain complexes that contain unique metal-metal bonding interactions, halogen-bonded adducts using N-oxides, green hydroarylation catalysts, and Mn cluster complexes with single-molecule magnetic properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
