 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Disrupting Operations of Illicit Supply Networks (D-ISN) project aims to design and develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented framework to detect, disrupt, and dismantle opioid trafficking networks, thereby enhancing public safety, health and welfare. Opioid trafficking is a serious national crisis that has been enabled by the use of modern technologies. Illicit drug markets hosted in darknet and popular social media platforms have emerged as important mediums for trading opioids, and opioid trafficking has also co-mingled with other trafficking networks such as virtual product trade. This project employs a holistic, systems-focused framework to better understand the dynamics and operations of these trafficking networks and will facilitate proactive response strategies. \r\n\r\nThe AI-augmented framework developed in this project will enable systematic aggregation and analysis of the large volume of data generated from both illicit drug markets hosted in darknet and social media platforms.  Specially, this project has four research objectives: (1) develop novel deep graph learning techniques to comprehensively model multi-source, multi-modal data with evolution over time for online opioid trafficker detection; (2) uncover the organizational structures (e.g., drug cartel, key players) of opioid trafficking networks through a new dual learning model; (3) develop novel interpretable trade flow reasoning to predict opioid trade routes and understand operational patterns; and (4) develop a novel adaptive reinforcement learning paradigm to enable expert-in-the-loop (e.g., healthcare/industry partners, government and law enforcement agencies) to facilitate an interactive process for opioid trafficking network interdiction. The research will advance scientific theory through a convergent approach that deploys computer and data sciences, engineering, public health, and social science to address the national opioid crisis. The outcomes of this project will be made publicly accessible and broadly distributed. The project will integrate research with education through novel curriculum development, student mentoring activities, and participation of underrepresented groups to train future generations in interdisciplinary research methodologies for opioid prevention.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
