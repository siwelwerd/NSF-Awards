 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles, but there are known holes in the theory. Many are connected to the neutrino, which we know can change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes in so-called neutrino oscillation experiments, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This award will allow a deeper understanding of neutrino properties and allow detailed simulations of future neutrino mixing experiments such as DUNE at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota.  The VA Tech team will involve undergraduate students in this analysis work and will reach out to high-school teachers through their QuarkNet center and the Virginia Tech Neutrino NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the DUNE project at (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award enables a deeper understanding and improved accuracy of nuclear effects in Argon and thus reduces the systematic uncertainties in the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments. This result will be obtained from measurements made at Jefferson National lab (JLAB) to determine neutron and proton so-called spectral density functions. These spectral density functions will tell us details of how neutrinos interact with the nucleus in Argon.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
