 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of digital health technologies (e.g., wearable devices and personalized medicine) that can be used to address sexual health problems.  There are nearly 10 million new cases of sexually transmitted disease (STD) each year in the U.S. Treatments for STDs are estimated to cost $16 billion annually. The proposed technologies seek to improve education and  communication and, in doing so, may provide positive health outcomes for both individuals and their families.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development improved parent-child communications and the reduction of healthcare costs associated sexually-transmitted diseases among adolescents. This innovation stems from the combination of several elements including building motivation for communication by shifting parental mindsets, providing skill-building exercises, and providing a new platform for parent-child communication. This combination of features is not currently available in any other book, website, or product on the market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This product is a digital communication platform to modernize parent&ndash;adolescent communication about sex and relationships. With support of the I-Corps program, our team has now conducted nearly 150 customer discovery interviews to explore the commercial landscape for the digital health communication platform we are pursuing. This has included interviews across several potential customer segments (parents of early and middle adolescents; employee assistance programs, insurance providers) and also with key partners (pediatricians, researchers, sex educators, pastors, school-based sex educators). We have received a lot of enthusiasm about a digital platform that can help parents communicate with their teens about sex and relationships. We have narrowed our customer segment to parents of early adolescents ages 10-13. The I-Corps program allowed us to hone our value proposition and receive mentored business training. In the past year, we have secured over $400,000 in non-dilutive funding to build out a minimally viable product (MVP). This MVP will be finalized in summer 2024. Once it is available, we will continue with customer discovery to refine the features that customers find most necessary and useful. We will also conduct additional market research to determine the best sales channels and price points to sustain the product over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Laura&nbsp;Widman</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
