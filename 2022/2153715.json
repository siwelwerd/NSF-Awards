The plate boundary setting of Guatemala exposes the country to numerous natural hazards including earthquakes from four source areas, volcanic eruptions along the active Central American Volcanic Arc, and landslides and floods that have intensified by more frequent tropical storms and hurricanes in a warming Earth. The Guatemala Geohazards IRES project has the potential of increasing both the number of women and under-represented minorities conducting research, completing a bachelor's degree, and continuing to graduate programs and careers in geosciences. Our IRES also brings diversity to the face of our role models with six Hispanic mentors and three women faculty mentors. Our collaboration with Guatemalan colleagues, industry mining geologists, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy. \r\n \r\nThe Guatemala City (GC) Metro sprawls over a high plateau composed of volcanic tuff and lava flows from active volcanoes that border the region to the south and southwest including Pacaya, Fuego, Acatenango, and Agua, and other volcanic centers along the arc, although the actual volcanic stratigraphy is poorly defined. The GC Metro area is cut by a system of active faults that define the N-S-trending Guatemala City Graben. Steep ravines or barrancos, that are likely fault-controlled, deeply dissect the landscape causing high susceptibility to landslides. This geologic and tectonic setting make it ideal for investigating the interplay of Quaternary volcanic, seismic, and landslide hazards of the region. Field access facilitated by industrial partners and new road cuts provide the ideal location to leverage high-resolution outcrop and satellite-based imagery alongside geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological data that can be used to quantify recent and active geologic processes including the sequence, style, and timing of volcanic eruptions, the kinematic and displacement history of faults and past earthquakes, and study of the underlying properties leading to landslide failure. The Guatemala Geohazards IRES students will have an unprecedented opportunity to develop field and laboratory skills in volcaniclastic stratigraphy, neotectonics, and landslide hazards while building international experiences and collaboration with Guatemalan students, mentors, and professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
