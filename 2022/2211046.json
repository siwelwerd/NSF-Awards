 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants interact with complex communities of organisms, and these interactions are influenced by environmental conditions as well as land and agricultural management practices. A phytobiome is a plant (phyto-) in a distinct geographical unit (-biome) that includes the plant itself, all micro-and macro\u00ad organisms living in, on, or around the plant and the environment, including soil, air, water, weather, and climate. Understanding the diversity and dynamic processes occurring within phytobiomes is critical to ensuring the sustained health and productivity of crops, plant ecosystems, and, ultimately, consumers of plants and plant products. The 4th International Conference entitled \u201cPhytobiomes: Bridging the Broad Range of Disciplines Involved in Complex Systems of Plant-Based Agriculture\u201d will be held September 13 -15, 2022 in Denver (CO) and will bring together a broad community of U.S. and international researchers and scientists from the public and private sectors to collectively advance the newly emerging field of phytobiomes research. Funding is provided to support the participation of early career investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and students through travel awards and by providing real-time virtual access to conference sessions as well as by publication of conference proceedings in an open access scientific journal. \r\n\r\nPhytobiomes 2022 will highlight cutting edge, multidisciplinary research in the study of microbiomes and the interactions between microbiomes and other phytobiome components. In addition, specific activities are designed to present students with an array of career opportunities to inform and recruit the next generation of plant scientists. Topical sessions include Phytobiomes & Farm Sustainability, Exploring Interactions within Phytobiomes, Predicting Life in Earth System Models, Imaging and Modeling of the Phytobiome, Communication among Microbes in the Phytobiome, Phytobiome Engineering, Paradigm Shift in Breeding for Sustainable and Precision Agricultural Practices, Regulatory Challenges Affecting Advances in the Phytobiome, Soils and Rhizosphere, and Applying Phytobiome-based Solutions. It is envisioned that these discussions will lead to the identification of strategic research priorities, technology or resource needs, and the establishment of collaborative, multidisciplinary research partnerships. Outcomes include the development and distribution of white papers, as well as education and outreach activities that will engage the scientific and agricultural communities and society at large to educate the next generation of early career professionals and students about the opportunities within phytobiomes science and applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
