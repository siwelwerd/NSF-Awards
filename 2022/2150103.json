 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Track 2: IEP aims to build upon existing education assets in Northeastern New Mexico to broaden student engagement in STEM. The project will be conducted in one of the poorest U.S. regions, with 28% of residents below the poverty line, and ~78% of individuals of Hispanic descent. Led by the ARMAS (Achieving Research in Math And Science) in Education Center at New Mexico Highlands University, the only four-year college in the region,  Cultivating Access to Manifest INtentional Outcomes in STEM (CAMINOS) will cultivate collaborations with regional two-year institutions of higher learning to 1) provide academic support and mentoring to students, 2) facilitate hands-on and culturally responsive learning experiences, and 3) deliver professional development opportunities to faculty. The goal is to recruit and retain students to STEM disciplines, promote student success, and broaden the STEM workforce by producing more STEM graduates with practical experience who are workforce ready. The project expects to deliver outreach to at least 1,500 high school students, coach STEM students from three regional community colleges, and improved mentoring/teaching skills for participating STEM faculty.\r\n\r\nThe CAMINOS project will modify and expand academic and nonacademic activities currently supported by the ARMAS program at NMHU to meet the HSI program goal of broadening participation of historically underrepresented groups in STEM. In addition, the project will provide an opportunity to increase understanding on how best to affect intersectional systemic change within a broad STEM community. CAMINOS will implement three novel and innovative initiatives to improve student success and broaden participation of historically underrepresented populations: (1) ARMAS Counts, a recognition/celebration program to increase student engagement; (2) ARMAS Connects, a synergistic partnership with three community colleges to more effectively recruit and support students; and (3) ARMAS Faculty Fellows to increase faculty engagement and awareness of students\u2019 assets, challenges, and barriers. The project will also include support for student involvement in grant-funded research and field experiences from the student experience coordinator to increase the number of students engaging in these experiences, leading to increased STEM completion and placement.  Lessons learned will be shared with universities and community colleges facing similar challenges to the region. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs.  Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
