 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2)\r\n\r\nThe development of a Research-Oriented Learning Experiences (ROLE) program at New Mexico State University (NMSU) will provide Latino/a college students with the tools and knowledge required to succeed in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) majors in particular, and in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)-related degrees in general. ECE is a field of great relevance for our modern society, and where Latinos/as are commonly underrepresented. This project will encourage Latina undergraduates to participate in high-impact research-oriented educational activities, where they will conduct research in collaboration with Latino/a graduate students and ECE faculty, leading to pathways to graduate programs. This project will also train Latino/a graduate students to mentor a selected group of undergraduates, in order that they can strengthen and refine their mentoring and leadership skills, which are very useful in STEM-oriented academia and industry positions. The involvement in research and mentoring activities will help increase students\u2019 engagement and leadership, realizing the importance and value of their engineering degree, and consequently, develop a strong sense of belonging to their major and campus. The benefits of ROLE are two directional; on the one hand, higher degree interest and attainment will increase for Latina undergraduate students in ECE; and on the other hand, Latino/a graduate students will feel better prepared to occupy leadership positions within their field either in academia or the private sector. By focusing on Latinos/as, a population relevant for the demographics of NMSU, this research project will produce outcomes aligned with the mission of the NSF\u2019s Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program, that are scalable, sustainable, and applicable to various contexts, settings, and demographics within Engineering and Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
