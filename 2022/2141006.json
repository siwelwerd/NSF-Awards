 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to improve clinical outcomes in neurology through a wearable device.  Many studies of the brain require measuring blood flow, but it is difficult to measure deep within the brain.  This project will develop an imaging system that addresses this concern.  This device will impact both research and clinical applications for improved diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop new wearable device for time-domain diffuse optical tomography (TD-DOT). TD-DOT relies on two critical pieces of hardware: short laser pulses (<30 ps), and time-gated single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) with fine timing resolution (<50 ps). Currently available TD-DOT hardware is too large for a wearable system and supports only a small number of such detectors, which limits the ability to perform optical tomography. The proposal aims at creating the first wearable, high-density array of time-resolved single photon detectors and combine this new hardware with advanced image processing algorithms to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The result will be the first real-time functional brain imaging system that delivers fMRI-level performance within a wearable form factor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn this effort, we have performed development and commercialization activities related to the design of a system for noninvasive functional brain imaging. The device, worn on the scalp, directs pulses of near infrared light produced by small solid-state lasers into the brain. The scattered light is collected by single-photon avalanche diodes, detectors that are capable of detecting individual photons and determining the arrival time of these photons relative to the pulsed delivery. All of the emitters and detectors are in the form of arrayed chiplets on a flexible patch. By delivering light from each array site and detecting the scattered photons at all of the other sites, one can collect enough information to measure the spatial and temporal characteristics of blood oxygenation levels in the brain. This blood oxygenation is a proxy for brain activity, allowing functional brain mapping to be performed. Such mapping today is performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), requiring multimillion-dollar machines in which the head has to be positioning in the core of a superconducting magnetic. The wearable device developed here has been shown to produce functional images of a quality that approaches MRI but in an inexpensive, wearable form factor. As part of this project, we performed customer discovery on market needs for such a device, including clinical applications in oncology, neurology, and psychiatry as well as applications as a general brain-computer interface device. A start-up company has been formed to commercialize the technology.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KennethLShepard\n"
