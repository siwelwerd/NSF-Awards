 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whether it is for online banking, shopping, teleconferencing or gaming, users notice if there is significant delay with an application on the Internet.  The networking research community and Service Providers have spent significant time and effort to minimize this interaction latency, and have come a long way in reducing them.  One key technique that has been devised is IP anycast. IP anycast allows Internet users to access replicated web content stored at a server close in network distance to them. In theory, a service provider that deploys many replica servers in diverse geographic locations expect to achieve low user latencies. However, in practice, this is often not the case: more replica servers sometimes lead to prolonged latencies.  This project aims to provide the research and network  operations community with the knowledge and tools to optimize the design of large-scale IP anycast systems such that these systems could achieve low Internet latencies with a minimal number of replica servers.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will develop techniques and tools to enable anycast optimization at scale. It will explore using randomized algorithms to reduce the number of BGP experiments needed for anycast catchment prediction and investigate whether incorporating Internet topology information is effective in further reducing the number of BGP experiments. It plans to study how multi-path routing and non-common BGP policies introduce errors into catchment prediction and whether these practices might improve the accuracy of catchment prediction. It will also examine whether heuristic knowledge such as the number of sites and the site locations and techniques such as divide-and-conquer to further scale anycast can be effective for performance optimization. Finally, the project will look at performance metrics other than latency such as load balancing and resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
