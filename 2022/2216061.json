 "awd_abstract_narration": "As multiscale applications become an integral part of humanity\u2019s challenges, it is important for students to gain an understanding of structure-property relationships. The measured parameters integrated into mathematical frameworks by students and faculty mentors will facilitate a faster response and greater resilience against health and climate crises. A subset of solutions enabled by equipment acquisition across inter-disciplinary fields is as follows:  a) design of artificial membranes to address biomanufacturing challenges during pandemics; b) use of artificial intelligence to identify defective biological filters; c) paper-based assays to detect pathogens, and, d) nanoparticle characterization to combat water pollution. Other emerging research areas include cancer diagnostics and renewable energy.   Sample acquisition times with the proposed equipment are 30 min suitable for a three-hour laboratory session, a rapid and economical solution when compared to costly multi-session imaging-based pedagogic methods. The proposed equipment will be integrated in several courses and laboratories across STEM, namely in materials characterization and immunology initiatives. A total of 200 students from a demographically diverse population will benefit yearly from this effort. Outreach efforts will extend to West Valley Community College and local high schools where students will be introduced to nanotechnology through online instruction and hands-on experimentation.  In the heart of Silicon Valley, student/faculty publications will empower academic and industrial translational opportunities, resulting in a skilled and motivated workforce accelerating the nation\u2019s global competitiveness.\r\n\r\nState-of-the-art instrumentation to investigate surface, bulk and interphase architecture will be used to address gaps in knowledge across multiscale applications at the biomaterials, health and climate nexus.  This will provide an understanding of structure property relationships, specifically in terms of pore size and porosity. Both micropores (< 2nm) and macropores (>50 nm) will be quantified. Porosity will be indirectly determined by density.  The generation of knowledge through experimentation with modern equipment and a first principle-based approach to problem-solving will enable robust scaling. In parallel, a material database featuring collected data from characterization tests will be constructed as a basis for statistical learning models and simulations. The data from this project will be disseminated so that other engineers and scientists can also use these training sets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
