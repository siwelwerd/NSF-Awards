 "awd_abstract_narration": "Different regions of the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere host different processes and phenomena. Near the magnetic equator, ionized gas or plasma often develops into highly structured plume forms, while closer to the poles either stable or traveling large-scale plasma structures occur. Many of these upper atmospheric phenomena have both radio and optical signatures, with radio communication channels being adversely affected by the plasma structures. Much can be learned about origins and impacts of upper atmospheric phenomena from observations of their optical signatures, particularly at multiple locations in the opposite hemispheres connected by the same geomagnetic field line (magnetically conjugate locations). The work will utilize the global network of 11 optical imagers previously deployed and currently operated by Boston University and focus on improved understanding of three phenomena: (1) structured plasma plumes at low magnetic latitudes, (2) medium-scale traveling disturbances at middle latitudes, and (3) stable auroral red arcs and related optical phenomena at subauroral latitudes. \r\n\r\nThe research will examine the role of the geomagnetic field configuration in producing inter-hemispheric asymmetries in upper atmospheric processes at different latitudes and longitudes. It will further investigate conditions leading to intrusions from equatorial and subauroral regions into middle latitudes, where most of the U.S. population resides, and the associated effects of the generated structures. Furthermore, this research will examine characteristics and magnetic conjugacy of subauroral optical structures. The work will foster international cooperation by leveraging imaging optical observations and science collaborators in South Africa, Mexico, and Europe as well as citizen scientists in Canada, US, Europe, and New Zealand. STEM educational opportunities for underrepresented minorities will be enhanced by investigators giving guest lectures and serving as judges for the O\u2019Bryant School for Mathematics and Science, a grades 7-12 Boston Public School with a very large minority population. Finally, this project will develop STEM workforce by supporting and involving students and early-career postdoctoral researcher in field observations and optical image processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
