 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioprinting technologies are critical enablers for fundamental research and applications in a variety of biomedical and biological domains. This grant will facilitate the acquisition of a high-resolution bioprinting system equipped with one-of-its-kind laser induced forward transfer (LIFT), micro-valve drop-on-demand, and micro-extrusion printing capabilities along with an imaging system driven by machine learning algorithms for in-line quality assessment of printed structures. LIFT, which enables precise, pressure-free deposition of individual cells and microparticles, in conjunction with the other two printing modalities, will catalyze fundamental and applied research in domains including additive manufacturing, tissue engineering, animal and plant cell biology, functional materials engineering, and bioelectronics. Hundreds of college and K-12 students, postdocs, and professional workforce at NC State University and partner universities and industry will be exposed to this system, the first of its kind in the state of North Carolina, through various research, education, and outreach activities. \r\n\r\nThis multimodal system, which enables micrometric precision and cellular and microparticle-level control during printing (resolution < 100 \u00b5m), will support various interdisciplinary research projects leveraging a broad range of organic and inorganic materials at multiple length scales. Examples of research activities enabled include: 1) LIFT process physics and process-structure characterization for musculoskeletal tissue engineering; 2) development of more reliable organoids (e.g. skin, gut, lung) for tissue engineering, oncology, and drug screening applications; 3) investigation of regulatory mechanisms that modulate cell-to-cell communication across different plant stem cells toward designing plants with desired traits; 4) designing functional soft material composites with specific compositions and micro-architectures to achieve unique photonic, mechanical, and biological properties; and 5) investigating bio-recognition pattern designs, specific binding chemistries, and surface interactions toward developing miniaturized, multiplexed biosensors and bioelectronics. The system will contribute to the development of therapeutic and diagnostic tissue engineered products; robust plants and agro-products; biomedical devices, sensors, and electronics; and functional soft materials among other applications of national and global importance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
