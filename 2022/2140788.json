 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable augmented- and virtual-reality (AR/VR) technologies with high visual quality at lower costs.  AR/VR technologies connect people with the digital world through immersive experiences, and present unbounded applications in many industries. However, these technologies face many obstacles, such as limitations in optical clarity and resolution. The display industry is in urgent need of new innovation that can achieve much higher resolutions than what existing technologies deliver. To this end, the industry is actively investing in micro-LED technology, where the pixel size nears an order of magnitude reduction from the current state of the art. Better resolution is desirable across the entire display industry, ranging from smartphones/watches to large panel displays, but micro-LEDs will benefit consumers most by transforming AR/VR. However, the manufacturing process of micro-LED displays is extremely time consuming and labor intensive, which leads to prohibitive costs, yields, and production times. The proposed technology is expected to profoundly reduce the cost of next generation displays for AR/VR and transition micro-LED displays from research to market.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project advances a technology that will propel micro-LEDs through the manufacturing obstacles into mainstream displays. The technology combines a micro-patterning method and innovative light-emitting material, compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing, and promises to significantly reduce the number of key steps in micro-LED manufacturing. Conventional micro-LED array fabrication requires processing each color of LED, blue, green, and red, on individual semiconductor wafers. These LEDs must then be separated and assembled on a display substrate through the manual and error-prone pick-and-place process. The proposed micro-color converter requires the creation of only a single blue micro-LED array, with no need to manage individual pieces. Color converters absorb light of higher energy and emit lower-energy light, and through patterning, select blue pixels can become green or red. The color converter utilizes metal-halide perovskite semiconductors, a cost-effective, solution-processible light-emitting material with outstanding optical properties. Like other organic materials, one significant challenge with perovskites is their incompatibility with standard photolithographic micro-patterning processes. The proposed technology bridges this gap by enabling micro-patterning of perovskites with many of the same photolithography tools already in production, while protecting the layers during fabrication thus maintaining the material\u2019s high optical quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Augmented- and virtual-reality (AR/VR) technologies connect people with the digital world through immersive experiences, and present unbounded applications in many industries.

Better resolution is desirable across the entire display industry, ranging from smartphones/watches to large panel displays, but micro-LEDs will benefit consumers most by transforming AR/VR. However, the manufacturing process of micro-LED displays is extremely time consuming and labor intensive, which leads to prohibitive costs, yields, and production times. In the project period, we demonstrated that a photolithography-based dry liftoff micropatterning method for quantum dot (QD) color converters can provide a feasible path to high-resolution micro-LED displays with low cost. This project provided outstanding training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and research scientists. A startup company spun out of the effort was incorporated to further pursue commercialization of the technology. The outcomes in Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts are summarized below.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits:</strong> We adopted a room-temperature synthesis process for green CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> perovskite QDs and achieved 93.6% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in solution with a narrow emission linewidth of 19.5 nm (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The PLQY of QD thin films is usually much reduced due to more surface defects and photon trapping. We were able to achieve 59% external PLQY while maintaining an emission linewidth of ~20 nm (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). A major goal of the project is to demonstrate that our micro-patterning technology is viable to achieve &gt;1,000 pixel-per-inch full-color displays. After optimizing our microfabrication processing parameters, we achieved QD patterns with ~1 &mu;m resolution (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), limited by the capability of the photolithography instrument in our on-campus user facility. Figure 3, micro-patterning of CdSe/ZnS QDs, further shows that our technology can be applied to all types of QDs. Since the display industry has not come to a consensus on the most suitable QD material, this is an advantage of our technology. To further demonstrate this unique feature, we integrated green CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> perovskite QDs with red CdSe/ZnS QDs (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). The un-patterned space can be used for transmission of the blue backlight to complete a full-color display. A pixel size is then determined by the distance between the adjacent red subpixel or green subpixel, which is ~25 &mu;m in the current result. This corresponds to &gt;1,000 pixels per inch density. The fluorescence images show bright emission from both QDs. Wafer-scale processing is necessary for semiconductor manufacturing. We successfully patterned green perovskite QDs on a 4&rdquo; wafer and achieve the targeted yield of &gt;80% (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). We also showed that our process is compatible with micro-LED manufacturing by patterning perovskite QDs on the sapphire substrate of a blue LED chip fabricated by us (<strong>Figure 6</strong>).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The National Science Foundation&rsquo;s Big Idea, Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, is a vast undertaking and will certainly motivate incredible technologies of the future. Modern innovation has already come a long way with the advent of computers and displays. However, human senses have always created a wall between user and machine, thoroughly limiting technological potential. Right now, we are on the verge of breaking this wall and truly immersing the user in the digital world through AR/VR. Our micropatterning technology has the potential to reduce the cost of next generation displays for AR/VR and transition micro-LED displays from research to market. The technology is compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing, and can significantly reduce the number of key steps in the process for high-resolution displays. A startup company was incorporated to advance this technology in its commercialization path, and we received NSF STTR Phase I funding to support the effort. Over the entire project period, this research program provided training opportunities for 1 PhD student, 3 MS students, 6 undergraduate students (2 through NSF REU support), 1 postdoctoral researcher, and 2 research scientists. It also provided mentoring experience for the postdoctoral researcher and the research scientists. A former MS student returned as a part-time research scientist and the CEO of the startup company to lead the commercialization effort.
