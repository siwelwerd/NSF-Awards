 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic functions of complex neural circuits in the brain mediate our behavior. Monitoring neural circuits over short periods of time and under constrained conditions will not provide a full picture of how neural circuits function under naturalistic behavior. Existing devices that are surgically implanted in the brain for long-term recording or stimulating neural circuits usually fall apart after a while and fail to interface with neurons for an extended period of time. In this project, the investigators seek to design a novel neural probe in the silicon carbide (SiC) material platform, which is a robust material, known to withstand harsh conditions. The goal is to design a penetrating neural probe that can last long in the corrosive environment of the brain and enable electrical recording as well as optical stimulation of neural activity in the brain. By combining electronics, photonics, and nanotechnology with biology and neuroscience, this project provides a unique training opportunity for students and researchers to learn how to work on a multidisciplinary project that bridges between different branches of science and engineering.\r\nThis project will develop a novel penetrating neural probe technology entirely made in SiC, a robust and reliable material that is proven to remain viable in the brain over a long period of time. These neural probes will include electrical recording functionality and optical illumination functionality to enable simultaneous electrophysiology recording and optogenetic stimulation of neural activity. This novel neural interface will address outstanding needs in the field, including (i) longevity and chronic viability, (ii) high spatial and temporal resolution recording, and (iii) localized targeted light delivery. The design of this novel neural probe technology builds on a host of innovations including (i) microfabrication of high-density electrical recording electrodes in SiC, (ii) reconfigurable photonic switch banks for realization of high-density probes with great scalability; and (iii) metasurface optical output ports for shaping the beam of light in the tissue to provide a seamless all-SiC interface to the brain tissue that enables long-term stability for chronic neural interfacing. The outcome of this cross-field research will be a new technology platform that can be used to test various neuroscience hypotheses on the role of specific neural circuits in encoding and transforming information in brain through long-term high-throughput neural recording and stimulation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
