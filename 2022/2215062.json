 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The University of Virginia is acquiring a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a probe with multinuclear capabilities to support the research of Professor W. Dean Harman and colleagues Robert J. Gilliard and Thomas B. Gunnoe. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of synthetic organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, catalysis, and chemical biology. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The multinuclear allows study of a wide range of elements above and beyond the common hydrogen and carbon atoms. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of a diverse group of students and investigators from fourteen research groups across five departments. The instrument also enhances the research experiences of undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups, at regional institutions.\r\n\r\nThe award of the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as small molecule therapeutics, synthetic methodologies, and molecular interactions with biological materials. This instrument enables research focusing on synthetic organic methods, chemical biology, transition metal complex characterization, main group chemistry, and in situ mechanistic studies. The research projects to be enabled by the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer could lead to impacts in fields such as renewable energy, catalysis, and medicinal chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
