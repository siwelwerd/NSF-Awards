 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Mexico Highlands University requests funds for the acquisition of upgrade research equipment to advance the capabilities of the Geospatial Applications in Natural Sciences (GAINS) Laboratory. The mission of the GAINS Laboratory is to serve as New Mexico Highlands University\u2019s geospatial technology resource center by providing a broad variety of geospatial hardware and software. The surveying geospatial equipment requested in this proposal will complement and expand the research, teaching, and learning capabilities of the facility. The intellectual merit of the many research and teaching endeavors attest to the breadth of the applications and services that the GAINS Laboratory provides. The laboratory will advance new and ongoing studies in archeology, engineering, geomorphology, tectonics, water resources, local and regional tectonics, volcanology, and new and on-going studies in wildlife, range, and natural resources management. The GAINS Laboratory serves as a hub for geospatial knowledge and technical support for a diverse group of partners including local, federal, and state agencies, non-profits, Native American tribes, and private landowners. The lab has developed training workshops and individual instruction to support local land management and asset inventory projects. It has also partnered with other New Mexico entities on unique projects to enhance community engagement using geospatial technologies. By driving the development of collaborative international research endeavors, the lab is also recognized across Europe and parts of Asia as an outward looking center of excellence.\r\n\r\nThe GAINS Laboratory at New Mexico Highlands University is the only Applied and Service Geospatial Laboratory in northern New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and the southern Colorado area. The surveying geospatial equipment requested in this proposal will complement and expand the research, teaching, and learning capabilities of the facility. The proposed instrument acquisition will facilitate GAINS users' research, serve the university, local, state, and private stakeholders, and support underrepresented student learning opportunities. The award will advance new and ongoing studies in archeology, engineering, geomorphology, tectonics, water resources, local and regional tectonics, volcanology, and new and on-going studies in wildlife, range, and natural resources management. The new equipment will advance the GAINS Laboratory mission, as well as that of the university, and provide partial funding in \"Support of Outreach and/or Broadening Participation Activities\" to engage other audiences in geospatial technology applications, workshops, and training. It also serves as the keystone of an international wildlife ecology collaboration among the Denver Zoo, William and Mary University, and various academic and conservation organizations in Mongolia. Undergraduate and graduate students transferring from other universities and community colleges have often developed superb geospatial data development and analysis skills. The new and existing infrastructure provided by the laboratory provides an environment where they can continue to develop and apply these hard-earned skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
