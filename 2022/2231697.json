 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Iowa Colloquium on Information, Complexity, and Logic - Summer Research Conference (ICICL-SRC) promotes collaboration among researchers whose interests are related to the theory of computation (ToC). One of the primary goals of this conference is to reinforce Iowa as a hub for ToC research within the national and international scientific communities. This conference will be held during the course of two days and will feature two invited speakers and several contributed talks. Students of underrepresented minority groups are especially encouraged to participate. This award will fund the conference during the 2023, 2024, and 2025 calendar years.\r\n\r\nThis conference will benefit both experts and students whose research areas are related to ToC and will also increase the visibility of the scientific contributions made by Iowa-based researchers to this field. Both undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate and will gain experience presenting their work and interacting with other experts within ToC. As part of ICICL-SRC, there will be a community outreach program to educate high school computer science teachers about the history and significance of ToC and the value of teaching this topic to students. This outreach program will be a half-day event that will take place prior to the research conference. High school teachers are encouraged to attend and may choose to participate in-person or online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
