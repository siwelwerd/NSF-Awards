 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes environmental chamber observations of multiphase smoke chemistry and the interactions of smoke with clouds. There currently exists an observational gap between laboratory experiments and field observations with regard to smoke plume chemistry.  Substantial uncertainties remain with regards to how smoke plumes age and evolve and how aerosols emitted and produced during the evolution of smoke plumes interact with our climate. Understanding how smoke interacts with sunlight and with clouds is a critical part of making accurate climate projections.\r\n\r\nThere are four primary objectives to this proposed work: (1) quantify dry aging and cloud processing effects on secondary organic aerosol formation and light absorption within smoke samples; (2) quantify these effects on smoke aerosol water uptake and semi-solid or liquid phase transition; (3) train and mentor 12 diverse undergraduate students; and (4) mentor and train a postdoctoral fellow teach at a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). Most of the experiments will be conducted in the Chambre de Simulation Atmosph\u00e9rique Multiphasique (CESAM) at the Universit\u00e9 Paris Est \u2013 Cr\u00e9teil (UPEC) in France. They are expected to fill a gap in the current understanding of smoke aging and cloud interactions, particularly with regard to brown carbon and differences between chamber and field observation data. This research involves whole-smoke and fractional smoke experiments that include secondary organic aerosol dry aging, cloud processing, and pyrocumulus cloud processing.\r\n\r\nThis effort includes a large number of undergraduate student researchers and provides them with substantial laboratory and international research experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
