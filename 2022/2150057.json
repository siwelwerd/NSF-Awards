 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of this project is that aims to increase the academic success rates of sophomore STEM students and narrow the achievement gap between under-represented minority (URM) or first-generation (FG) and other cohort members by immersing students in an authentic research experience. Attrition rates for STEM students in their second year are significant, especially for URM and FG students. The project supports students during this critical period, they will persist in STEM majors and ultimately increase their representation in the workforce. Houston Baptist University (HBU) is a four-year undergraduate Hispanic-Serving Institution in Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the nation. HBU\u2019s College of Science and Engineering student population is 18% African Americans, 47% Hispanic, and 19% FG. Instructors and peer-mentors will guide students through a research project which promotes the development of their research and interpersonal skills, both essential in the STEM workforce. The expected outcome of this work is to promote students\u2019 self-identification as scientists, which will ultimately lead to increased academic persistence.\r\n\r\nThis project will apply the knowledge students are learning in their sophomore-level Cellular and Molecular Biology course, which in turn is expected to increase success rates. Students will also receive purposeful instruction in research techniques and interpersonal skills, to prepare them for a future STEM career. Both short and long-term goals of this project include increased success rates in STEM courses, narrowing achievement gaps between URM/FG students and other members of their cohort, increased graduation rates, and an increase in sense of belonging within the STEM community. The project\u2019s focus on student driven research is a proven approach for increasing science engagement of minorities, Hispanics, and women and will increase overall student retention in STEM programs and prepare young people for entry into the STEM workforce. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
