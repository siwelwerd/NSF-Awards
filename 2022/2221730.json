 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanologists use a variety of sensors to monitor volcanic activities, relying heavily on seismometers to record signals from subsurface magma movement. However, because volcanic edifices highly attenuate and scatter seismic waves, critical seismic signals may go unrecorded unless a dense network of seismometers is available. In many volcanic areas, it is impossible to deploy such a network using conventional seismometers due to logistic and/or environmental limitations; such as areas close to an active volcanic crater being inaccessible. Existing techniques for remote sensing of seismic signals have safety or resolution limitations. In this EAGER project, a new remote sensing technique will be developed using the enhanced Moir\u00e9 technique. Moir\u00e9 patterns are produced when two similar straight-line patterns (called gratings) are overlaid and rotated relative to each other by a small angle. Small displacement of the grating (i.e., straight -line patterns) is magnified through the Moir\u00e9 patterns, and hence can be measured accurately. In this approach, one grating is placed by a UAV in the remote location and the other within a telescope in the base station. Thus, the displacements (vibrations) of the remote location can be recorded remotely. The major challenge that hampers the ability of this method for the remote sensing of seismic signals is the presence of atmospheric turbulence that can create significant noise within the recorded signals. To address this challenge advance pre- and postprocessing techniques will be developed and numerically tested on the remotely recorded seismic signals to assess the accuracy of the method to measure ground displacements for various atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nA new remote sensing technique will be developed for measuring seismic waves. The approach is an enhancement of the Moir\u00e9 technique, which images the patterns produced by differential motion between straight-line grids. In our case, one of the grids is placed on a remote location by a UAV and the other, within a base telescope. This technique can measure minuscule ground displacement but is subject to signal degradation due to atmospheric turbulence. We will develop both pre- and postprocessing techniques to reduce the effect of turbulence. The optical preprocessor will use a novel and transformative distortion/noise suppression scheme called active convolved illumination (ACI), in which the image spectrum is systematically modified using dielectric metasurfaces. Here, using numerical simulations, the performance of ACI to reduce the effect of the atmospheric turbulence will be assessed. While the ACI work will test the feasibility of significantly enhanced data acquisition, a postprocessing procedure based on the deep learning and wavelet packet decomposition method (DL-WPD) will be developed and applied to the data to further enhance the accuracy of seismological measurements. If successful, this new remote sensing technique will improve our understanding of volcanic processes by enabling seismic recording in otherwise inaccessible areas. In addition, because seismology is an essential tool for forecasting volcanic eruptions and mitigating the associated hazards, the novel instrument will directly benefit society. Moreover, other disciplines such as earthquake seismology, and civil and mechanical engineering can adopt the proposed method to obtain high-quality seismic signals for a variety of applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
