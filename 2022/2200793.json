 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a tool that enables rapid bacterial detection and antibiotic susceptibility testing. There is a critical unmet need for faster, sensitive, and affordable diagnostic tools to detect bacterial sepsis and identify appropriate antibiotics. The ability to customize antibiotic treatment within hours is particularly critical when treating sepsis. Each year, sepsis impacts 1-3 million U.S. patients, leads to 270,000 deaths, and costs over $60 billion. Most sepsis associated deaths are preventable with rapid diagnosis and early, effective treatment. Current standard of care involves an average 3-day turnaround. Shortening the time to diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment has the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes, reduce hospital costs, and promote antimicrobial stewardship. Competing technologies require pathogen identification and growing bacteria to a detectable density, both adding to the overall diagnostic timeline. Furthermore, competitors are instrument-based, making them financially inaccessible to many hospitals. The proposed technology does not require pre-test steps and relies on standard clinical lab equipment. In addition, sepsis mortality is higher in low-income areas, and the proposed technology may improve outcomes for all sepsis patients, including the most vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel tool for bacterial growth detection and antibiotic susceptibility profiling. The proposed technology pairs probes that mimic bacterial cell surface building blocks with an amplifiable colorimetric assay to create a solution to detect bacterial sepsis and identify appropriate antibiotics. The proof-of-concept data suggest that the proposed assay may rapidly detect bacterial growth and distinguish growing from nongrowing bacteria, including antibiotic susceptibility profiling, in less than 4.5 hours. In addition, the data also show that detection is dose-, bacterial density-, and time-dependent, and compatible with common sepsis-causing bacteria regardless of their cell surface architecture. Further, the assay may be performed using equipment found in standard clinical labs. While the current focus is on developing a kit for rapid detection and drug susceptibility profiling of blood-borne pathogenic bacteria, the technology may be adapted to detect the growth of bacteria in a variety of settings such as food and biomedical manufacturing facilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We hypothesized that our test has the potential to break down health inequity barriers and expand access to innovation that can improve patient outcomes and mitigate the global antibiotic resistance crisis. To test this hypothesis and learn how we can maximize the impact of our technology, we interviewed &gt;200 stakeholders, including physicians, clinical microbiologists, nonprofit representatives, industry experts, and administrators. We interviewed experts from 25 countries, from rural and urban regions, well-funded and resource-limited organizations. We found that healthcare providers often prescribe inappropriate antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results that guide treatment can take ~3 days. Treatment prescribed during this wait may be ineffective, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Alternatively, treatment can be overly aggressive, causing side effects and life-long medical complications. Importantly, uninformed treatment leads to antibiotic overuse which contributes to the global antibiotic resistance crisis. Current rapid tools that condense this diagnostic timeline involve specialized, costly instrumentation. Due to cost, these tools have a limited market reach, leaving most of the world&rsquo;s clinical facilities without access to rapid AST. The broader impact of our technology, as guided by findings from customer discovery can be divided into 3 categories:<br /><strong> 1. Socioeconomic-based health inequity:</strong> Socioeconomic status is a major health outcome determinant. This includes bacterial infection mortality and morbidity rates, which are higher in low-income communities. Adequate laboratory capabilities are the backbone of a functional health system and are essential for clinical management. Expanding testing services in vulnerable communities is hindered by the lack of accessible tools. Thanks to NSF I-Corps interviews, we have practical insights from experts around the world to guide us in product development, to ensure that our solution meets the needs of resource-limited healthcare centers in the U.S. as well as in low and middle income countries (LMICs). <br /><strong> 2. Antibiotic resistance: </strong>Antibiotic overuse accelerates our path towards a post-antibiotic era. Infections that were recently curable now have grim prognoses. According to experts, antimicrobial stewardship has the potential to slow down the spread of resistance. Like most public health crises, low socioeconomic communities are predicted to suffer most from antibiotic resistance. Our customer discovery interviews have shed light on the role of human behavior, clinical decision-making, and shortcomings of current technologies. These learnings are invaluable to creating a solution that will preserve our antibiotics for generations to come.<br /><strong>3. Gender-based health disparities:</strong> Our initial goal was to develop an antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) for bloodstream infections as Latde&rsquo;s first product. However, through customer interviews, healthcare providers and industry experts advised that an AST for urinary tract infection (UTI) would be a stronger first product candidate. UTIs are often treated in small, outpatient settings that would greatly benefit from a low-cost diagnostic tool; UTIs are a common cause of sepsis. Guiding early, effective treatment would prevent this potentially fatal outcome; UTIs are the most common bacterial infection in humans. Due to their prevalence, UTIs are a major sink for antibiotic overuse. Early treatment de-escalation will promote antibiotic stewardship. Additionally, women are prescribed antibiotics more frequently than men. According to experts, there are significant diagnostic gaps in conditions that disproportionately or solely affect women, such as UTIs, mastitis, and prenatal testing. Therefore, we see this as an opportunity to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for millions of women around the world.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: M&nbsp;S&nbsp;Siegrist</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
