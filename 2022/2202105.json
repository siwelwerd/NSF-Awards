 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a cloud computing program to meet a regional workforce need. The cloud computing industry has grown exponentially at an unprecedented rate especially during the pandemic.  Community colleges nationwide, however, have not yet widely created curriculum and supporting materials to effectively train technicians in this rapidly growing field. There are widespread workforce gaps of cloud computing technicians. This project will develop new courses that will strengthen knowledge in cloud technologies, virtualization, storage, operating systems, networking, and cybersecurity. A collaboration with other institutions and industry partners has the potential to help program adoptions with curricula and best practices to jumpstart a workforce training pipeline in cloud computing. The project team intends to focus on the recruitment of women and students from underrepresented groups in order to meet the growing demands of cloud computing technicians in Tampa region. The project has the potential to advance knowledge of accelerating the development of cloud computing training programs.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to develop a cloud computing curriculum with stackable courses towards a college-credit certificate and an associate degree. This goal will be met through four objectives: 1) Development of a clouding computing curriculum that will foster an environment of learning and success through hands-on experiences in cloud technology courses; 2) Acquisition of expertise and technical knowledge through a Business and Industry Leadership Team and a mentoring collaboration with the Cloud Computing Center at Miami Dade College; 3) Provision of opportunities to secondary and post-secondary faculty by taking cloud certifications; and 4) Recruitment activities including job preparations, and retention services. In addition, the project will provide an annual summer program of cloud computing for high school and college students in collaboration with local public schools. The project team plans to disseminate the proposed curriculum and practices in recruiting students from underrepresented groups at various national and regional conferences. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
