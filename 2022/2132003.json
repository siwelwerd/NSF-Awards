 "awd_abstract_narration": "If neutrinos are proven to be their own anti-particles, it can offer an explanation of the prevalence of matter over anti-matter in the universe. The only experimentally feasible way to answer this question is to look for neutrinoless double-beta (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) decay, a proposed form of nuclear decay. Large Ge crystals have a higher volume-to-surface ratio which is advantageous for the collection of signals and rejection of backgrounds in a search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. GERDA and MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR have proved that a Ge-based ton-scale experiment can be built with sufficient low-background that will achieve a sensitivity capable of the potential discovery of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. This RII Track-4 proposal will develop large-size Ge ring-contact (GeRC) detectors to further reduce backgrounds, complexity, and cost. The proposed research will advance Ge detector technology for cosmology, astronomy, homeland security, and industrial applications. Results from this project will be published in scholarly journals and disseminated through collaboration with industry. Research activities are closely integrated with education and outreach efforts: both graduate and undergraduate students will work on the project, thus gaining cutting-edge skills and expertise in Ge crystal purification and detector development. The main focus of undergraduate education and outreach activities is to encourage women to pursue STEM majors. \r\n\r\nThe sensitivity goal for the Large Enriched Ge Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) Decay (LEGEND-1000) requires a background level of \u22641\u00d710^(-5) events/keV/kg/year. LEGEND-1000 prefers large-size detectors (>3 kg per detector), which will further reduce backgrounds, complexity, and cost. This RII Track-4 proposal will explore large-size detectors through research and development (R&D) on GeRC detectors using high-purity Ge crystals grown by the University of South Dakota (USD). With the collaboration of Professor Rusty Harris (Host) of Texas A&M University (TAMU) and Professor John Wilkerson (collaborator) of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the PI will fabricate GeRC detectors at TAMU and test them at UNC. Currently, LEGEND-200 has successfully tested inverted coaxial point-contact (ICPC) Ge detectors that have a typical mass of ~2 kg. To further increase the mass per detector, a new detector concept based on GeRC detectors is promising, as it can potentially be used to make a Ge detector as large as ~6 kg.  Although they have been modeled, a GeRC detector has yet to be fabricated and tested for its energy resolution and pulse shape properties. The degradation of energy resolution seen with Ge detectors that is due to incomplete charge collection in large-size Ge crystals will also be an obstacle for LEGEND-1000. This project will help to resolve three key challenges: fabrication of a GeRC detector with a mass of ~2 \u2013 3 kg, measurement of the energy resolution and pulse shape discrimination in a large-size GeRC detector, and analysis of the quality of USD-grown crystals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Neutrinoless double-beta decay is a rare nuclear process that, if observed, would provide crucial insights into the nature of neutrinos and the violation of lepton number conservation. The LEGEND collaboration aims to search for this decay using high-purity germanium detectors with improved performance and reduced backgrounds.</p>\n<p><br />Key Findings and Achievements:</p>\n<p>The project made significant progress, despite encountering challenges related to the principal investigator's transition to a new institution in a non-EPSCoR state. Here are the key findings and achievements:</p>\n<p><br />1.<span> </span>Fabrication of the First Detector: The project achieved a significant milestone by successfully fabricating the first ring-contact germanium detector at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU). This involved employing precise lithography and sputtering techniques to create a highly sensitive detector with improved performance capabilities. Notably, the fabrication process faced a challenge in creating the ring contact geometry, as the proximity of the grave to the inner hole posed a risk of potential crystal cracking due to mechanical stress. However, this challenge was successfully overcome through careful design considerations and meticulous processing. The experience gained from addressing this challenge provides invaluable insights for future detector fabrication endeavors.</p>\n<p>2.<span> </span>Testing at the University of North Carolina (UNC): The fabricated detector was sent to UNC for testing. However, the initial test results were not successful due to the inability to bias the detector effectively. This setback necessitated a refabrication plan to address the biasing issue.</p>\n<p>3.<span> </span>Collaborations and Research Infrastructure: The project fostered collaborations between Texas A&amp;M University and the University of North Carolina, enabling the exchange of knowledge and expertise in detector fabrication and testing techniques. These collaborations have strengthened the research infrastructure in both institutions, enhancing their capabilities in experimental particle physics.</p>\n<p>4.<span> </span>PI Transition to a New Institution: Unfortunately, during the project's progress, Dr. Wenzhao Wei, the Principal Investigator, accepted a position at a new institution in a non-EPSCoR state. This transition disrupted the continuity of the project and introduced challenges in completing the remaining 20% of the research.</p>\n<p><br />Impact and Lessons Learned:</p>\n<p>The project's achievements have laid the groundwork for advancements in ring-contact germanium detector technology and contributed to the LEGEND experiment. Despite the challenges faced due to the principal investigator's transition and the unsuccessful initial test, the successful fabrication of the first detector demonstrated the feasibility of the chosen approach. While the project faced significant challenges and was not able to achieve its original objectives due to the PI's departure and the subsequent disruptions, it is important to highlight the lessons learned and potential impacts:</p>\n<p>1.<span> </span>Lessons Learned: The project highlighted the importance of continuity in research projects, particularly in complex and multi-stage experiments. It underscored the need for effective project management strategies, clear communication, and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as personnel changes.</p>\n<p>2.<span> </span>Future Collaboration Opportunities: Despite the project's incomplete status, there may be opportunities for collaboration between the new institution and other research groups involved in germanium detector development. The knowledge gained from the project's early stages can still be leveraged to contribute to the broader scientific community's efforts in neutrino physics.</p>\n<p>3.<span> </span>Training and Skill Development: The project provided valuable training opportunities for graduate students and researchers involved in the fabrication and testing processes. The experience gained during this project can contribute to their skill development and future research endeavors.</p>\n<p><br />Dissemination of Results:The project has internally disseminated its results through project reports and presentations within the research team and the APS meetings. Publication and external dissemination of the findings are pending further developments and successful detector testing. The project team recognizes the importance of sharing its findings with the wider scientific community and will continue to work towards publishing its results.</p>\n<p><br />Conclusion:The RII Track-4 project on the research and development of ring-contact germanium detectors for LEGEND has made significant progress, despite the challenges encountered. The successful fabrication of the first detector and the collaborations established between Texas A&amp;M University and the University of North Carolina have advanced the research infrastructure in experimental particle physics.</p>\n<p><br />We express our gratitude to the National Science Foundation for their support in funding this research project and acknowledge the need for continued efforts to overcome the project's challenges.
