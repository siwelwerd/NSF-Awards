 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support participation in the live virtual 2022 International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference. IGSC has established itself as the premier conference in this area.\r\n\r\nThe conference will make researchers and students aware of the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. Plans are to support up to 25 -30 participation grants to students who may otherwise not be able to attend IGSC and take advantage of the available learning and networking opportunities in the newly evolving research area of green computing. The grant recipients will be expected to participate in IGSC PhD Forum and to report their learning experiences once the conference is over.\r\n\r\nThe papers in IGCC deal with power, energy, and temperature related research topics particularly in parallel and distributed computers. These papers would be of interest to researchers, graduate students, engineers, and practitioners. The conference aims to publish only high-quality papers and emerges as a leading academic conference with significant industrial participation. The rigorous review process ensures that only quality papers are accepted. The program committee comprises of leading researchers and leaders from academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
