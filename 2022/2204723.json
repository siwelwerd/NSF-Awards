 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sage Days Duluth workshop will be held at the University of Minnesota Duluth, June 6-9, 2022. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of mathematicians to focus on increasing the functionality of essential low-dimensional topology software, and also on training new users in development of this software. The workshop will follow a format used in recent Sage Days conferences, which is very effective in terms of both education and software development. The participants will be brought up to speed on the current state-of-the-art for three-manifold computations in SageMath, after which much of the time will be spent in small groups, working on development and training. To supplement this, the workshop will also feature talks about software development, usage, and best practices, as well as lightning talks about current research. Participants from from a wide range of mathematicians, including early career researchers and researchers from liberal arts and regional institutions will be invited to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\nAfter introductory sessions introducing the software, the workshop will center upon group work in SageMath and SnapPy development. A key goal of the workshop will be to restore functionality found in the original snap program as verifiable exact computations. The workshop will also aim to add the ability for SnapPy to perform computations with orbifolds, and implement better methods in SnapPy for identification of non-hyperbolic manifolds. The increased functionality in SageMath and SnapPy will be a valuable research tool for mathematicians around the world doing research in low-dimensional topology and is also an excellent tool for undergraduate research projects. Information about the workshop is on the webpage https://sites.google.com/d.umn.edu/sagedaysduluth/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
