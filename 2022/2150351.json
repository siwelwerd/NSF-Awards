 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, a Hispanic Serving Institution on the Texas Gulf Coast and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved site for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), will continue to offer a ten-week summer research experience in UAS technology to ten undergraduate students per year. Students are selected through a nationwide recruitment process that encourages participation of students from groups underrepresented in computing. This unique research experience opens the door for undergraduate researchers to a wide range of applications of UAS to address problems of regional and national significance, such as coastal management, coastal ecology, human safety, precision agriculture, and security of UAS technology. The REU Site organizes many beneficial, transformative activities such as mentoring of participants by a team of experienced faculty, skill-building seminars and workshops, research presentations, graduate school preparation, and other professional development activities.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the program is to provide participants unique research experiences in a stimulating environment that involves developing secure, autonomous UAS technology. Activities include research in applied computing for UAS-based applications as well as a series of skill-building training sessions designed to enhance group cohesiveness and to hone their technical writing, communication, and research skills. Primary research activities occur in the areas of autonomous UAS, security of UAS, and applications of unmanned systems in a variety of domains. The participants write and submit research papers on their work in local, regional, and national symposiums. Through the REU Site, the participants explore opportunities of UAS technology in commercial, civilian, and governmental applications, develop confidence and passion for research, become motivated in seeking advanced degrees, and be inspired in life-long learning in computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
