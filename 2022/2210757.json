 "awd_abstract_narration": "Convection \u2013 the turbulent motion of ascending air parcels \u2013 is one of the hardest processes to capture in global models of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Yet, it is critically important to our planet\u2019s past, present, and future climate. Because Earth\u2019s present-day convection occurs over a narrow range of conditions, to reach a deep understanding of this phenomenon, there is a strong need for additional modeling and theoretical work that probes conditions beyond our current climate. In this project, a sophisticated model that can resolve convection and cloud formation directly will be used to perform investigations over a wide range of conditions. The model results will yield new insights into climate conditions on Earth in the distant past and on other planets. Importantly, they will also be used to \u201cstress-test\u201d existing theories of convection and its influence on planetary climate. The research focuses on very hot atmospheres (as occurred during Earth\u2019s distant past) that are distinguished by their high humidity. Whereas tropical air in today\u2019s climate contains at most a few percent of water vapor, this project will simulate atmospheres that are so warm that water vapor becomes a major atmospheric constituent. It is currently unknown how cloud updraft speeds, areal coverage, and large-scale circulations such as hurricanes behave under such conditions.\r\n \r\nThe research will offer a new view into the behavior of convection and climate during exotic periods of Earth\u2019s history, such as the aftermath of global Snowball glaciation events. Such glimpses of \u201calien\u201d versions of our own planet are powerful tools for piquing curiosity and drawing students into geoscience. The investigator will leverage an existing relationship with the Harvard Museum of Natural History to communicate research findings to the public and broaden engagement from the diverse populations that visit the museum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
