 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an integrated software for geometrical modeling, design optimization, simulation, and the generation of 3D printing input for composite lattice structures. Using the proposed software technology stronger parts will be designed, the analysis of composite additively manufactured (AM) parts will be automated, and the fabrication of various designs will be more efficient. The preliminary results of the proposed technology suggest that it has the potential to design advanced composite structural concepts that are an order of magnitude stiffer than the state-of-the-art laminate composites with the same weight. The integrated software will prompt the ubiquitous adoption of the 3D printing of fiber reinforced polymers in various sectors, such as the medical, aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors, which can benefit from the high-performance composites. The optimized composite AM may be utilized for a variety of applications, some of which are tooling, molding, primary and secondary load-bearing structures, and high-rate, large-volume manufacturing. By addressing the critical design and analysis issues, the integrated software technology will contribute to the growth of composite AM from the current level of 1.5 billion USD to the predicted 9 billion USD in 2028.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of multiscale design optimization by utilizing the effective properties of lattices obtained by numerical homogenization. Due to the use of spatial harmonics, the construction, homogenization-based optimization, and projection of various types of lattices with different degrees of anisotropy are possible. The published experimentally validated results of proposed framework demonstrated that the optimized additively manufactured (AM) composite designs are 100% stiffer and 50% stronger than current composite structures. This project includes the following new features: 1) combined continuous fiber paths and ply layout design optimization in 3D printed composite laminates; 2) constructing a coherent shape-preserving orientation to establish an interconnected microstructure; and 3) incorporating printed fiber and printing resolution constraints in the design process. Composites lattice structures with arbitrary fiber patterns can be difficult to model because the fiber angle varies from element to element. Thus, the proposed automated modeling framework is developed to create a 3D printed fiber polymer and interfaces with finite element analysis to perform and return the weight, displacements, stresses, and local failures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
