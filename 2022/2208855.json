 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic Topology: Methods, Computation, and Science (ATMCS) is a biennial conference on algebraic topology and its applications. The tenth ATMCS meeting will be hosted by Oxford University, the week of June 20\u201324, 2022. The program includes invited talks, contributed talks, and a poster session. As many as 350 participants from around the world are expected at the conference. This project will support the travel of US-based participants to the meeting. \r\n\r\nThe areas represented at the meeting will include multivariate persistent homology, directed topology, stochastic topology, inverse problems, algorithms and software development, topological data analysis (TDA) in machine learning, network data analysis, and applications of TDA. By supporting the cross pollination of ideas, the conference will directly impact research in the United States. Participant support costs will be prioritized for early-career researchers. A conference website is available at https://atmcs.web.ox.ac.uk/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
