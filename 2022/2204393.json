 "awd_abstract_narration": "A week-long workshop, a so-called Ideas Lab, will bring together different members of the life science community to better understand how the full set of genetic components that are present in living organisms are used to sustain their functions. Part of the DNA that has been characterized in living organisms (the genome) is transcribed into RNA that encodes for proteins that in turn perform biological functions (growth, metabolism, movement, etc.). Yet a large part of the genome produces diverse classes of RNA that do not encode proteins and that remain vastly uncharacterized in their function. Given that these types of molecules are known to exist in all living systems, it is important to understand their function. This is relevant to understanding how living systems function and adapt to their environment, as well as to develop new technologies with applications in bioeconomy, including agriculture, medicine, and bioenergy. In addition to supporting insightful exchanges among scientists of different expertise and backgrounds, this workshop will ultimately provide educational opportunities for students and postdocs in interdisciplinary research, as new research projects will be developed as result of this Ideas Lab.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Dimensions of the RNA Regulome (D2R2) Ideas Lab will be a week-long workshop designed to bring together new research teams from a broad range of disciplines to address cutting-edge questions about the evolution and functional significance of RNA molecules that ordinarily do not encode proteins. Gaining a deeper understanding of this poorly characterized set of molecules will help illuminate dark dimensions of the complex interplay between genotype and phenotype. Although non-coding RNAs are virtually ubiquitous among living organisms, their roles are poorly understood and difficult to define. This Ideas Lab is expected to lay the groundwork for fundamental advances in molecular and evolutionary biology. This project will bring together biologists, chemists, physical scientists, and bioinformaticians to develop cutting edge research with substantial potential for translation to applications that are relevant for the bioeconomy. In addition, this Ideas Lab will give rise to educational opportunities for students and postdocs, as several interdisciplinary research projects will be developed as result of this lab.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
