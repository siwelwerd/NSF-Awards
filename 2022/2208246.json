 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \u201cFrom Subfactors to Quantum Topology\u201d will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, June 27 - July 1, 2022. The topics will cover quantum invariants in low-dimensional topology, subfactor theory, and their connections to many branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. The conference will consist of talks by leading experts as well as early-career mathematicians. Many talks are survey talks directed to a wide audience and suitable for graduate students and young mathematicians. This award provides partial travel support to US-based mathematicians, particularly those in the early stages of their careers.\r\n \r\nThe conference will address topics on quantum invariants, topological quantum field theories, Khovanov and Heegaard Floer homology, the volume, AJ, slope, and knot-quiver conjectures, subfactors, and planar algebras,. It will provide a venue for sharing new results in the related fields; it will increase collaboration and communication among research experts globally; and it will introduce researchers, especially students and early career researchers, to important areas of current research. The conference website is\r\nhttps://www.nccr-swissmap.ch/news-and-events/events/subfactors-quantum-topology-memory-vaughan-jones\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
