 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the development of a fundamental electronic building block (i.e., smart amplifier) situated near sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, thereby enabling ultra-portable, ultra-low power integrated circuit (IC) uses in medical (including wearables), industrial, defense, and environmental applications. Existing amplifier ICs (fabricated in low-cost conventional fabrication) are not smart and cannot simultaneously alter noise, power, gain, and speed performance in response to different input conditions. The proposed innovation enables new, commercially viable, impactful products at the intersection of machine learning, IoT, and sensors. Applications employing such a building block include: (1) battery operated necklaces with always-on sound sensors and smart amplifiers, plus localized machine learning to detect and warn of asthma attacks; (2) multiple always-on ultra-low power, low-noise smart amplifiers near denture or filling-implanted sensors that simultaneously read levels of sugar, salt, acidity, and temperature, with harvested energy from chewing; and (3) \u201calways-on\u201d toxicity sensors having thermo-resistors whose resistivity changes upon detecting toxic chemicals or gasses. The innovation enables fast response times by delivering sufficient output sink-source current to continuously drive the thermo-resistors between low and high toxicity conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated circuit (IC) smart amplifier that intelligently alters its performance in response to input conditions. Anticipated technical results include: ultra-low-power, low-noise, high-speed, near-zero input-current, high-gain, high power-supply-rejection-ratio, high common-mode-rejection-ratio, unconditional stability, rail-to-rail input and output voltage swings, and an output buffer having source and sink load capability performance, all in one tiny silicon amplifier. The proposed smart amplifier is capable of providing all of these parameters in a single IC. In this Phase I project, the company will develop this IC amplifier based on a novel circuit design that intelligently alters its speed, noise, and gain in response to small signals and large signals applied to its inputs. As a fundamental building block, the resulting smart amplifier will be manufacturable using conventional, low cost, 65 nanometer IC fabrication processes, and will enable many emerging ultra-portable, ultra-low power \u201calways-on\u201d IoT, smart sensors, and localized tiny machine learning applications situated at the edge of the cloud, without the need for continuous internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The sAMP, shown in Figure 1, is considered \"smart\" because it can maintain low noise and ultra-low power consumption when a coupled sensor is in a steady state, and intelligently activate high-speed mode when the sensor detects a change at its inputs. Amplifiers are fundamental electronic analog building blocks, with hundreds of millions of units used annually in various industries, including consumer electronics, medical, automotive, industrial, and telecommunications. The proposed sAMP targets a niche industry, focusing on ultra-low-power and low-cost amplifiers designed to sit next to a sensor, enabling &lsquo;always-on&rsquo; smart IoT and near-sensor AI applications.</p>\n<p>During NSF Phase 1, to demonstrate the silicon feasibility of sAMP (and the accompanying &lsquo;bias current&rsquo; circuit), Ai Linear fabricated four test chips fabricated in shared wafer shuttles (spaced over 2 years), as depicted on the east side of Figure 2. These included multiple topologies for each of sAMP, as well as IREF, and IPTAT cells to better select an optimal &lsquo;bias current&rsquo; for the sAMP.</p>\n<p>Analog chips generally carry high R&amp;D risk within a system, and technical feasibility is established by comparing \"silicon results\" against \"simulation results\" and \"pre-simulation\" objectives. For brevity, \"typical-simulation\" results are summarized in Tables 2, 3, and 4, for comparison with \"silicon results\". These tables depict the layout image of respective sAMP, IREF, and PTAT cells in the middle, as well as comments regarding testing in the lower section of the tables. The feasibility of the smart amplifier was confirmed through proof of silicon, wherein (worst-case ad monte-carlo) simulations and chip evaluations are generally in line. The innovation of boost-on and boost-off to increase speed when an impulse is applied to the sAMP input was successful, with no oscillations or lock-up conditions observed. Additionally, the sAMP cost targets were met (below ~10 cents). Performance metrics such as noise, offset, gain, PSRR, and input/output rail-to-rail range were in line. However, power consumption and dynamic response were higher than pre-simulation goals, though they remained within the worst-case and montecarlo simulation results. Given the benchmarking results attained here, trade-offs between noise, power consumption, and dynamic response can now be better fine-tuned for production&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The diversification of IP by employing multiple sAMP topologies across the four wafer shuttles fabricated over two years allowed mitigating the risk of relying solely on one sAMP topology in case it underperformed. To our knowledge, the combination of specifications achieved by the sAMP is unmatched in the industry for a CMOS amplifier, offering the following 'all-in-one' traits using a low-cost, 65nm and 180nm lagging-edge standard digital CMOS fabrication process: 1V &lt; VDD &lt; 2V; rail-to-rail I/O dynamic range within 50mV of power supplies; -5mV &lt; VOFS &lt; +5mV; 60nA &lt; IDD &lt; 140nA; 80dB &lt; Gain &lt; 95dB; 7uV/&radic;Hz &lt; VOUT Noise &lt; 5uV/&radic;Hz at 10Hz; -70dB &lt; PSRR &lt; -90dB; and 20uS &lt; TS &lt; 60uS. Prototype testing generally performed within the ranges predicted by monte-carlo and worst-case simulations, providing confidence in the accuracy of the benchmarking between silicon and simulation results. This reinforces the expectation that future sAMP designs can be fine-tuned in simulation to achieve realistic and achievable results in silicon.&nbsp; In summary, the results of Phase 1 research proved the feasibility of the smart amplifier and demonstrated its practical benefits for smart IoT and near-sensor AI applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Ali&nbsp;T&nbsp;Far</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725395967048_01_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725395967048_01_Figure_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725395967048_01_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Smart Amplifier Architecture</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ai Linear Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ali&nbsp;T&nbsp;Far\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396162272_03_Table_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396162272_03_Table_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396162272_03_Table_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results of NSF Phase 1: Smart-Amplifiers</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ai Linear Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ali&nbsp;T&nbsp;Far\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396226673_04_Table_3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396226673_04_Table_3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396226673_04_Table_3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results of NSF Phase 1: IREF section of Smart-Amplifier</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ai Linear Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ali&nbsp;T&nbsp;Far\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396083163_02_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396083163_02_Figure_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396083163_02_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Accomplishments of NSF SBIR Phase 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ai Linear Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ali&nbsp;T&nbsp;Far\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396280058_05_Table_4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396280058_05_Table_4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2208366/2208366_10834804_1725396280058_05_Table_4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results of NSF Phase 1: IPTAT section of Smart-Amplifier</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ai Linear Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ali&nbsp;T&nbsp;Far\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 4</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
