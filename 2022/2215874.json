 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Southern Oregon University is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with a broadband probe to support the research of Professor Hala Schepmann and colleagues Samuel David and Anna F. Oliveri. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of aluminum chemistry, organic chemistry, and natural products.  In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in the department. The instrument is leveraged by students from underrepresented groups in hands-on research and research training experiences.\r\n\r\nThe award of the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as polyatomic nanoclusters, organic synthesis, and natural products. This instrument enables research focused on the characterization of nanoscale aluminum oxyhydroxide clusters to elucidate speciation of aluminum in aqueous solution and the development of new synthetic methodologies to produce substituted phenol and benzoquinone ring systems.  Other investigations include the total synthesis of the natural products floricolin and aspernigrin and the identification of a plant growth hormone in P. elata (African teak).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
