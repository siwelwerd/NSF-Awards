 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Fayetteville State University supports faculty and undergraduate research experiences investigating the molecular mechanisms of gene expression. Specifically, the project seeks to examine the regulatory pathways of pyocyanin (virulence factor) production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pyocyanin is highly regulated, extracellularly secreted, and easily quantifiable, making it an ideal target for studying gene regulation.\r\n\r\nP. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic bacterium that is ubiquitous in nature, ranging from soil to jet fuel. Due to the vast range of mechanisms necessary for P. aeruginosa survival, adaption, and antibiotic resistance, there is a need to better understand and explore these regulatory pathways and elucidate the molecular underpinnings. This project targets pyocyanin production to study virulence gene regulation and discover novel regulatory pathways. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) characterize the role that environmental factors play in pyocyanin regulation, 2) determine how various transcription factors and small molecules affect pyocyanin regulation, and 3) explore if the regulatory pathways of pyocyanin can be applied to other virulence factors in P. aeruginosa. This study will advance our understanding of pyocyanin regulation and has the potential to serve as a roadmap for understanding how other virulence factors are regulated. The data generated from this work will aid future experimental exploration of pyocyanin and the regulation of other virulence genes in P. aeruginosa. Ultimately, the implementation of this research project will be centered around teaching and training undergraduate students in hypothesis-driven research experiences. Students will develop skills in experimental design, critical reading, and understanding primary literature, enhancing their preparation for graduate school and/or the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
