 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project seeks to improve persistence and retention in gateway science courses and increase research opportunities for freshman students at Tougaloo College.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project will be realized by combining two pedagogies, adaptive learning and POGIL (process oriented guided inquiry learning), that have been proven effective in improving students\u2019 learning experience and outcomes. The project design aids students of various background knowledge levels to reach the same competency in mastering concepts in general chemistry courses. To ensure the success of unprepared students, a new course which incorporates math components with chemistry concepts will be developed. This course will help students build connections between science and math skills which is beneficial for their learning in advanced courses. This project also equips and engages first-year students in research through independent and course-based undergraduate research experiences. The ultimate goal of the project is to increase students\u2019 strength in pursuing a STEM major and to improve the quality of STEM education and research at HBCUs. The approaches developed through this project will present an effective model for colleges facing the challenge of first-year STEM student attrition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
