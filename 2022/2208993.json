 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY2022, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Wild animals are frequently infected by multiple parasitic organisms simultaneously. Studies of warm-blooded animals (endotherms) \u2013 mammals and birds show that interactions between coinfecting parasites can have profound impacts on the ability to combat disease. For example, parasitic worms (macroparasites) often dampen immune responses, thereby, facilitating infection and disease caused by pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi (microparasites). This phenomenon is known as the \u201cmacro-micro facilitation hypothesis.\u201d Despite the common occurrence of parasitic coinfections in wild cold-blooded animals (ectotherms) \u2013 fish, amphibians, and reptiles, little is known about the interactions between macro- and microparasites in these animals and how these influence ectotherm physiology (such as the immune response) and disease outcome. This research will be one of few studies to evaluate the mechanisms underlying macro-micro facilitation in an ectothermic animal. By advancing understanding about how interactions between coinfecting parasites shape ectotherm disease ecology, this research will provide new insights for ectotherm conservation in a changing world. The Fellow will design and implement educational activities and will create resources and research opportunities to promote the inclusion and success of middle school and college students underrepresented in biology. \r\n\r\nThis research will use field surveys, laboratory analyses, and advanced statistical modeling to test the macro\u2013micro facilitation hypothesis in wild snakes focusing on the fungal microparasite Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, which causes the recently emerged skin disease ophidiomycosis. While the threat of ophidiomycosis to snake biodiversity remains unclear, sublethal impacts may have substantial consequences for population health and stability. The Fellow will describe how parasitic worm infections, O. ophiodiicola infections, and ophidiomycosis severity are correlated across multiple snake species and over time in one widespread snake species in eastern North America. The Fellow will then use structural equation modeling to identify and quantify the causal pathways that directly and indirectly link the many physiological, environmental, infection, and disease variables measured in wild snakes. The Fellow will participate in broadening the representation of underrepresented student in biology by 1) partnering with local outreach events to create activity kits and presentations focused on how environmental change influences snake health for fourth grade classrooms; 2) creating a social networking platform to connect and support foster care student populations at the host institution; 3) mentoring and providing independent research opportunities for undergraduate students through the host institution\u2019s Applied Ecology Minor program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
