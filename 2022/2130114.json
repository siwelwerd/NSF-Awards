 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, Growing Opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (GO STEM), will contribute to meeting the national need for well-educated scientists, engineers, and technicians in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).   Indian Hills Community College will award scholarships to at least 48 unique low-income students with demonstrated academic potential and who are pursuing associate degrees in science and applied science fields of study.  Full time students in ten programs will be eligible to apply for these scholarships.  The ten programs include: four Associate of Art degree programs for science transfer majors (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics) and six Associate of Applied Science programs in career and technical programs (Computer Software Development, Cybersecurity and Systems Administration, Electrical and Renewable Energy Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology, Laser and Optics Technology and Robotics/Automation Technology).  A system of curricular and co-curricular activities will provide additional support for the scholars.  These activities focus on existing, enhanced, and new activities that show promise in fostering student success, as documented in the research literature, supported by prior experience and lessons learned, and underscored by institutional commitment.    \r\n\r\nActivities include intensive faculty mentoring/advising, professional development for faculty, peer mentoring, training for peer mentors, a first-year seminar series for scholarship recipients, college and career guidance, and summer experiences.  The overarching goal of the proposed effort is to increase the successful attainment of education and career goals of low-income community college students with academic potential and interest in STEM.  The project will advance knowledge by evaluating the influence of academic advising/mentoring provided by faculty mentors, participation in a first year seminar, and peer mentoring (as mentees and mentors) on college and career outcomes for academically talented, low-income students pursuing associate degrees in STEM.  The project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.  It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
