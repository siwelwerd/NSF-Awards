 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scholars and journalists have long recognized a phenomenon called \u201crally \u2018round the flag\u201d in which citizens support their country\u2019s leaders during a time of crisis. In the current era, however, increased political polarization may mean citizens never support leaders from an opposition party regardless of national and world events. We investigate whether a new formulation of the \u201crally \u2018round the flag\u201d effect has emerged: \u201crally \u2018round democracy\u201d \u2013 i.e., crises now lead to an increase in support for democratic principles among citizens in democratic countries instead of increased support for political leaders in those countries. We collect survey and social media data  during the Russian invasion of Ukraine to study the opinions of citizens in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany and the rhetoric used by political leaders in those countries during wartime.  This unique dataset of public opinion and elite rhetoric is available for use by other researchers.\r\n \r\nWe conduct a multi-country, multi-wave design to test the emergence and responsiveness of \u201crally \u2018round the flag\u201d  and \"rally 'round the flag\" patterns and effects during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Since the research is conducted during the conflict, the concurrent social media analysis allows us to speak to differences between the public and \u201copinion leaders\u201d during a crisis.  The survey takes place over three waves \u2013 two during the crisis, and one after the crisis largely concludes (or becomes significantly less salient in each of the three countries). We use social media to capture elite rhetoric in each country to track what they say about the crisis and their country\u2019s political leadership. We merge the social media data with our surveys to contextualize our participants\u2019 media environments. In sum, this project allows us to open the \u201cblack box\u201d that often hides public opinion on foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
