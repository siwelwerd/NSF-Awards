 "awd_abstract_narration": "Guestworker programs generate income for temporary migrants, while simultaneously allowing host countries to fill domestic labor demands and address labor scarcity. Current research suggests that the economic returns to temporary migration\u2014both for foreign workers as well as for the home and host countries at large\u2014are substantial. In the United States alone, more than one million temporary foreign workers are employed annually in both agricultural and non-agricultural capacities. However, we know very little about how guestwork and the remittances that guestworkers send to their families alter consumption behaviors back home, shape intra-household dynamics, and investments in children\u2019s education and human capital. Our study focuses on farmworkers who come to the U.S. on H-2A visas.  Our study will be able to assess how participation in guestworker programs can help families rise out of poverty; the extent to which guestworker programs serve as an alternative to unauthorized migration; and if the wages they receive can serve as a deterrence to criminal behavior and participation in illicit economies, such as drug cultivation. Understanding whether and why U.S. immigration policy can have developmental effects abroad will be crucial for reforming existing programs regulating foreign labor as well as for informing policy debates over temporary migration, food security, and poverty alleviation.  \r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the H-2A program, which issues visas to temporary or seasonal agricultural laborers for work on U.S. farms for a maximum of one year Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), this project will manipulate the immigration status of would-be guestworkers in order to understand how access to temporary work abroad alters economic, sociological, and ideological outcomes by comparing differences across \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d groups. For this project, the treatment group will comprise of those who received a guest visa and the control group will comprise of those who did not. The investigators will measure outcomes at the individual and household levels, and will collect metrics relating to human development, victimization, illegal behaviors, as well as political, civic, and social attitudes, Using remote high-frequency survey tools, the investigators will also collect data at all stages of migrants\u2019 journeys from to the U.S. and then back home; this will allow investigators to measure guestworkers\u2019 final locations, independent of whether they leave their home locations. The investigators will also seek to directly quantify the substitution between authorized and unauthorized forms of migration by tracking the location of persons in their control group who did not receive a guestworker visa. Findings from this research will help inform domestic policy-making on immigration policy and contribute to ongoing conversations about H-2A program reform, which has long operated in the absence of rigorous impact evaluations. We also seek to contribute to conversations over international and domestic policies aimed at ensuring food security and alleviating poverty.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
