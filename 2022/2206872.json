 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a \u201cGraduate Meeting on Combinatorial Commutative Algebra\u201d at the University of Minnesota the weekend of May 13-15, 2022.  It will bring together graduate students and researchers in related fields from a broad geographical region. At the event, research ideas and knowledge will be shared, encouraging collaboration and increasing connections between mathematicians at various career levels with algebraic and combinatorial interests, among others. This gathering will help build community and advance the professional development of graduate students and recent PhDs. This will be accomplished by longer lectures by postdoctoral faculty and shorter talks and poster presentations by those at the student level.  Additionally, structured conversations during lunch breaks will provide career guidance and open dialogue on professional matters.\r\n\r\nCombinatorial commutative algebra, the overarching mathematical theme of the event, has cross-disciplinary appeal, connecting to algebraic geometry and topology, applied and computational algebra, combinatorics, number theory, and representation theory.  Therefore, participants in the conference will be exposed to, and share, a variety of research avenues and lines of questioning.  The latest developments the field will be discussed.  The meeting will take place the weekend before the international conference Open Problems in Algebraic Combinatorics occurs at the University of Minnesota.  The breadth of the connections, as well as the proximity of the two events, will attract participants from around the country and enrich the intellectual environment of the meeting.  Participants will learn about recent advances and techniques and be exposed to various research directions and open questions. For more information on the conference, see https://math.umn.edu/~mahrud/GradMoCCA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
