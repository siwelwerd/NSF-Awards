 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constraining the depth at which magma feeding volcanic eruptions is stored in the crust is critical both for volcano monitoring agencies to interpret unrest signals during volcanic crises, and for our understanding of the formation of energy-critical metal deposits and the evolution of the Earth\u2019s crust. However, popular techniques using earthquakes and ground deformation to obtain storage depths cannot be used at many potentially hazardous volcanoes which show little activity at present, or have limited monitoring networks. More widely applicable methods which measure the chemistry of erupted crystals are associated with large uncertainty. This team will investigate a powerful but under-used approach in volcanology, by measuring the densities of pockets of gas-rich fluids trapped within growing crystals, known as fluid inclusions (FI). This method has the potential to be significantly more precise and accurate, placing very tight constraints on where magma is stored in the crust. After investigating the strengths and weaknesses of depths from FIs using eruptions from Hawai\u2019i and Canary Islands as a case study (where storage depths have been determined by other methods), magma storage depths will be investigated in a series of explosive eruptions that occurred several centuries ago at both locations where future eruptions of this type present a significant hazard. A rapid response simulation will be carried out in collaboration with Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) to determine just how quickly estimates of magma storage depths can be obtained during the next large eruptive crisis, and how this information can be used to inform decision making to mitigate societal risk. This proposal will foster close collaborations between three PIs with complimentary scientific expertise at different career levels, and support several students and a postdoc in a multi-tiered mentoring structure spanning three institutions. The team will develop and distribute synthetic and natural fluid inclusions to be used as calibration standards, and a workshop will promote collaboration and synergy between different research groups using Raman spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award will capitalize on recent advances in the spectral and spatial resolution of confocal Raman spectroscopy, allowing highly precise and accurate measurements of the densities of CO2-rich fluids trapped within fluid inclusions down to ~ 1 \u00b5m in size. The simple physical relationship between the density and pressure of a CO2-rich fluid means that distributions of FI densities can be converted into magma storage pressures with very small errors (~5-10%), and then magma storage depths using known crustal density profiles. First, detailed comparisons of depths obtained from FIs will be compared to published work investigating melt inclusion saturation pressures in samples from K\u012blauea Volcano, Hawai\u2019i, and Timanfaya, Canary Islands. This will permit assessment of sources of uncertainty affecting FI barometry such as decrepitation (when the inclusion explodes) using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD), and the presence of additional volatile species (e.g., S, Cl, H) using synthetic FIs equilibrated with different fluid compositions. After determining the strengths and weaknesses of fluid inclusion barometry, new constraints will be placed on changes in magmatic plumbing during explosive to effusive transitions at K\u012blauea Volcano (a significant societal hazard), evolution from shield to post-shield in the Gal\u00e1pagos, and from unknown samples during an eruption simulation in collaboration with HVO. Synthetic FIs with different concentrations of CO2 will be synthesized and characterized with an experimentally calibrated Raman system to distribute to laboratories around the world to use as standard reference materials for calibration of Raman Spectrometers. This will eliminate systematic offsets between densities determined in different laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
