 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle settling is affected by turbulence in various environmental and industrial settings. Examples include vertical fluxes of nutrients via the settling of plankton and marine snow particles, deposition of marine debris such as microplastics on river, lake and sea beds, and settling tanks in wastewater treatment facilities. An accurate understanding of settling velocities in such applications would improve efficiency and minimize environmental impacts, but gaining this understanding is challenging since such particles are often too large to be modelled as small points. Thus, the principal aim of this project is to understand the underlying physics that leads to altered settling rates of larger particles in turbulent flows. The project will also include the design of a bench-top experimental facility that will provide research, education, and outreach opportunities for undergraduate students in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at UW-Madison. \r\n\r\nSettling of finite-sized particles in turbulence are characterized by (1) particle interactions with turbulent flow that occur at Reynolds numbers above unity and (2) complex and multiscale particle-turbulence interactions as the particles distort the local flow around them. Previous work in this regime has found that particle settling rates in turbulence are reduced relative to terminal velocities in quiescent fluid, but it is unclear how this should be understood in terms of the underlying physical mechanisms. This project seeks to fill this gap in understanding by conducting a thorough experimental investigation into settling regimes of finite-sized particles, exploring a range of particle sizes, densities, and volume fractions. The experiments will use the newly constructed octagonal turbulence chamber and three-dimensional high-speed camera measurements of flow and particle motion. The focus will be on identifying new scaling parameters that capture turbulence effects on particle settling rates, including the effects of particle clustering. It is expected that this approach will lead to the identification of mechanisms that alter particle settling rates based on scaling laws that collapse data across a range of parameters. In turn, this understanding will lead to a new predictive model that could inform future designs in water treatment and ecosystem engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
