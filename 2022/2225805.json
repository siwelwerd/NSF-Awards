 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\n This project aims to serve the national interest by developing scholars skilled in data science and statistics to understand behavior. Advances in behavioral and neuroscientific research over the last decade have led to the production of large datasets ranging in scale from activity in single neurons to social behavior in large groups. Processing and distilling this data \u2013 to understand the mind and brain, and to develop ways to address questions of societal importance \u2013 is of national importance and requires individuals with interdisciplinary training in data science, statistics, and psychology/neuroscience. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in research opportunities that has disproportionately affected individuals from underrepresented groups, making it more difficult for them to pursue STEM careers in understanding behavior and the mind. To this effect, this project aims to create a new, two-year post-baccalaureate program in data science and psychology, designed to provide intensive training for careers in academia and/or industry. This project intends to develop the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers with skills in both data science and psychology/neuroscience, specifically targeting those from underrepresented groups. The significance of this project is the production of a highly skilled and diverse workforce in an increasingly important domain that spans basic science and industry.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a bridge program that provides individuals from underrepresented groups with two years of training to prepare them for STEM careers in academia and/or industry. The training scope will be in three domains. First, participants will engage in active research mentored by a faculty member with expertise in behavior and/or neuroscience. This research will culminate in multiple deliverables, including a thesis-level peer-reviewed publication that will bolster both doctoral and industrial career opportunities. Second, participants will enroll in curriculum specific to this program, with courses focused on developing skills in data science that can be applied to understanding behavior and the brain. Third, participants will engage in professional development via a group seminar along with clearly defined, accessible pathways to ensure progress towards their chosen career. The outcome of this training will be a set of tangible skills and experiences for the student, which will increase their competitiveness in the workplace and provide economically important skills to the academic and industrial marketplace.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
