 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the social and environmental conditions that contribute to toxic algal blooms in freshwater systems. Harmful algal blooms affect freshwater systems worldwide and result in billions of dollars in economic losses to industry, recreation, and public health. The role of historical, socio-cultural, policy and ecological characteristics of lake systems are investigated through partnerships between researchers and community organizations to identify key social and environmental drivers of toxic algal blooms. The project advances the theory and practice of sustainability science research by developing the concept of emplaced sustainability, which proposes that sustainability solutions must be based in the histories, cultures and ecologies of specific places. The project provides high-impact research experiences for >45 undergraduate students. Broader impacts resulting from project activities include policy briefs, workshops for regional stakeholders, a traveling multimedia pop-up exhibit, K-12 teaching resources, a project website with blog, and articles in popular media. \r\n\r\nCyanobacteria blooms develop through a set of interrelated social and environmental conditions. Land use decisions by distal land owners contribute to algal blooms resulting in a disconnect between critical actors and the place of impact. This negative spatial externality poses a particular obstacle to developing effective policy solutions to reduce the prevalence of algal blooms and mitigate their impact. Researchers and community organizations will co-develop social and environmental practices through application of a theoretical approach grounded in place-based research methods. This project integrates analysis of policy and regulatory documents, archival research, spatial analysis of environmental conditions, participant observation, in-person and online surveys, focus groups, interviews, and sampling and analysis of water quality and bloom severity to inform a predictive model to forecast severity of cyanobacteria blooms. Data from narrative journaling, histomapping, and focus group discussions are used to consider perspectives of diverse stakeholders in developing place-based policy solutions. Through application of a framework grounded in emplacement, this project furthers fundamental development of sustainability as an ongoing dialogue among people and places. In addition to theoretical contributions, empirical research on toxic cyanobacteria blooms will generate novel methodologies with which to examine and address this important environmental problem. A large cohort of undergraduate students will receive training in sustainability science and the development of environmental policy solutions through participation in project workshops, training in data collection protocols and development of public education materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
