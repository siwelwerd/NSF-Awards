 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands the realm of experimental- theoretical simulations of the processes occurring in Earth\u2019s molten iron core that generate the geomagnetic field. It provides fundamental laboratory data characterizing convective turbulence. The outputs of this project will help to benchmark and validate advanced theories of the Earth's core flow and to build predictive models of planetary dynamo generation. This work will be useful to models of Earth's core and other planetary dynamos, fluid turbulence, solar and stellar convection zones, as well as oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. This project also will provide training in laboratory experimentation, numerical and theoretical modeling to three graduate students, at least two undergraduates and one postdoctoral researcher.  The project disseminating information on a set of do-it-yourself experimental tools that can be used with students of all ages and backgrounds (https://diynamics.github.io/).\r\n\r\nThis project is comprised of three main tasks. In Task 1, the researchers will carry out rotating convection experiments in water and silicone oils that are elucidating principles about turbulent core convective flows. For Task 2, the project will continue a series of liquid metal convection experiments, enhanced by closely-coupled numerical simulations. These experiments will focus on making the first ultrasonic Doppler measurements of velocity fields in turbulent magnetostrophic convection, to quantify and diagnose the complex dynamics occurring in a simulated polar parcel of Earth\u2019s core fluid. Task 3 will carry out coupled laboratory-numerical simulations of rotating convection occurring at low latitudes in Earth\u2019s core via the development of a new parabolic free surface convection device.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
