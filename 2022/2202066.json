 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of diversity and the shortage of qualified workers in the technical sector is a well-known and well-documented problem that is making it difficult for companies to hire workers across the entire technology sector. This project will address local industry needs while at the same time supplying broader insights into effective strategies for diversifying the Information Technology workforce in a rural region, and formalizing career readiness skill development within a highly technical curriculum. Career readiness skills will be embedded throughout the core Computer Science Technology program, providing students with the opportunity to take industry certification exams and to learn and practice job skills. The result of this project will be a more diverse, career-ready technical workforce that can support the continued growth of Chesapeake College\u2019s Computer Science Technology program and the growing population on the Delmarva Peninsula. \r\n\r\nFour career readiness skills (teamwork, customer service, communication, and professionalism) and 12 soft skill competencies will be embedded into the program\u2019s six core courses. Students will be provided with vouchers enabling them to take two industry certification exams, providing the opportunity to further develop their Information Technology skills. Responding to local workforce needs for students with help desk experience, a help desk simulation lab will be established to provide students with hands on experience providing customer service using help desk software while at the same time allow them to improve their soft skills. To assess the extent to which the project achieves its objectives, the evaluation will consist of formative questions and summative questions that will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the objectives of the project are being achieved. Project results will be disseminated through presentations at state and national conferences as well as through ATE Central.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
