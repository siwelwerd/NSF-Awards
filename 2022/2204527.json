 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite many recent advances in volcano monitoring, unforeseen volcanic eruptions pose a major hazard to human life and property around the world. Beyond the direct threat to the volcano\u2019s immediate surroundings, ash clouds from such events can have far-reaching consequences, contaminating water supplies and rendering large sections of airspace unusable to commercial or defense traffic. Moreover, even foreign volcanoes can endanger American lives, given their popularity as tourist destinations. For example, the December 2019 eruption of Whakaari (White Island) in New Zealand left 5 American citizens dead and wounded 4 others. As with many deadly eruptions in recent history, this event was \u201cphreatic\u201d, driven primarily by the explosive release of shallow superheated steam rather than by the direct action of deeper magma. Such eruptions tend to occur suddenly; in many cases local monitoring networks do not observe any clear or reliable indication that an explosion is imminent. In these scenarios, local authorities are unable to evacuate the area, leading to significant casualties even from relatively small eruptions. Using Whakaari as a case study, this project will combine sophisticated computer simulations with years of monitoring data, spanning 3 eruptions, to investigate the volcano\u2019s longer-term evolution. In particular, it seeks to study how non-eruptive activity at Whakaari may have predisposed or primed the system for the observed explosions. Ultimately, this process will deepen the scientific understanding of phreatic eruptions in general, beyond just Whakaari, and will allow these volatile events to be forecasted more reliably, even in the absence of immediate warning signs.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of this project will synthesize previous advances in numerical modeling to develop a finite element simulation capable of fully capturing the poroelastic interactions between a volcano\u2019s shallow hydrothermal system, from which phreatic eruptions are most often triggered, and the surrounding host rock. By combining the physics of fluid flow with those of rock deformation, this model will be able to predict how the volcano would mechanically respond to different configurations of permeability and magma influx. The second phase of the study would then use statistical data assimilation techniques to compare these predictions against measurements of ground deformation at Whakaari, finding the sets of underlying conditions that best match the volcano\u2019s observed behavior. These models can then be further constrained and validated by comparing their predictions against additional seismic and geochemical observations. In the end, this project aims to test the hypothesis that Whakaari\u2019s eruptions were caused by the mechanical rupture of low-permeability hydrothermal seals which had caused the slow accumulation of pressure in the months to years beforehand. Additionally, it will determine whether the modeled stress state of the system would have been sufficient to cause seal failure alone, or if an additional external trigger was required. By considering phreatic eruptions in the context of a volcanic system\u2019s longer-term mechanical evolution, this study will help to understand how there events are triggered, what precursory activity may occur beforehand, and why certain precursors may be present for some eruptions but not others.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
