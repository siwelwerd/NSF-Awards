 "awd_abstract_narration": "Questions about how unequal power relations emerge and are transformed across time and space are central to the social sciences. Scholars studying colonial expansion are particularly interested in how novel configurations of land, labor, and capital structured asymmetrical power dynamics across colonial contexts. Assessing dynamics of power through specific relations of production is especially important within colonial borderlands, where diverse social networks, contested jurisdictions, and disputed resource control shaped the development of borderland institutions. Archaeology is particularly well suited for examining the political economy of colonial borderlands, through its ability to document the infrastructure and production strategies that characterized particular places. This project will explore political-economic relations in a colonial borderland. Through the investigation of the specific relations of production that supported local colonial institutions, this research will contribute to the political economy of colonialism. Focused on power dynamics in the decades leading up to a violent conflict, this research also enriches understandings of the conditions which lead to rupture and violence in colonial contexts. This research is part of an interdisciplinary heritage project that explores the relationship between cultural heritage and local community identity. Research will contribute to ongoing, community-driven efforts to uncover and preserve histories about life before, during, and after a violent conflict. \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation is primarily concerned with examining the political-economic relations that structured local power dynamics within a colonial borderland. More specifically, this research investigates local iterations of one colonial institution, the landed estate, and the role of local landed estates in the economic, political, and social networks of this region prior to violent conflict. The researchers assess evidence for estate control over the production of commercial goods, the organization of labor, and the distribution of scarce commodities by assessing the presence and distribution of infrastructure features (water management systems, sugar refining areas, laborer housing, storage features, roads) across four landed estates. The archaeological investigation of estate infrastructure will elucidate the specific production strategies that shaped the distribution of power within this colonial borderland.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, large haciendas focused on the production of sugarcane and henequen, or sisal, dominated the Yucatecan landscape. These estates enclosed lands previously used for communal systems of rotating milpa agriculture and gave rise to the growth of an indebted, predominantly Maya labor force. While historical and archaeological studies of haciendas have focused on the large estates established near the Spanish colonial administrative centers of Merida and Campeche, our research examined haciendas established along the edges of Spanish colonial administration between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One of the primary goals of our study was to understand how small haciendas in the eastern Yucatan Peninsula compared to the later, industrial haciendas of the 19th and 20th centuries. How did these estates shape the lives of Maya communities in Yucatan's colonial hinterland by controlling land access, labor relations, and local economic activities?</p>\n<p>NSF funding supported two seasons of collaborative research with members of the Tihosuco Ejido (federally recognized communal land organization), in the region surrounding the former colonial parish seat and creole town of Tihosuco. Within the Tihosuco Ejido, six out of ten documented haciendas have masonry principal houses constructed in an apsidal form. These houses appear as more ornate versions of the apsidal pole and thatch houses constructed by many historic and contemporary Maya communities. Due to the high proportion of haciendas with apsidal house forms -clear investments in outward displays of Maya identity- we decided to study two of the largest examples of these haciendas, Hacienda xCulumpich and Hacienda San Jose&nbsp; xCafe, to consider the role of these estates in regional power dynamics.</p>\n<p>We removed dense vegetation from large areas of the haciendas to document estate infrastructure including water systems, corral networks, housing areas, and production features to understand the economic strategies of these small haciendas and consider questions about the control and organization of local labor as well as the participation in interregional trade. Documented infrastructural features support the hypothesis that these haciendas operated on mixed economic regimes including livestock production, sugarcane cultivation, and interregional exchange. Interestingly, the only evidence for sugarcane cultivation comes from <em>aguardiente</em>, or cane liquor, distillation infrastructure and suggests that sugarcane was being cultivated at a small-scale for local consumption rather than commercial trade. The absence of clearly delineated and segregated laborer living spaces suggests that these estates did not operate with the same, hyper exploitative labor dynamics that defined late 19th and early 20th century haciendas.</p>\n<p>The stories, memories, and interests of local collaborators shaped the direction of this project, resulting in an expansion of the temporal boundaries of this research. While co-PI Samantha Seyler set out to study the 18th and 19th century history of these landed estates, the research program quickly expanded to include the 20th century reoccupation and reuse of these places. Our research demonstrates that historic haciendas provided critical infrastructure for Maya families looking to escape land insecurity, political instability, and exploitative labor arrangements following the Maya Social War (1847-1901) and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920).</p>\n<p>This research is part of a broader interdisciplinary research program that collaborates with local Maya people to construct new narratives about the Maya past, present, and future. As Tihosuque&ntilde;os look toward the future and consider how to represent their identity and history in the tourist landscape of the Yucatan Peninsula, this research provides diverse stories about Maya communities living in the region from the 18th century to the present. The haciendas within the Tihosuco Ejido offer complex stories of Maya landowners simultaneously participating in an increasingly capitalistic market system of the 18th and 19th centuries while operating outside of the typical, hyperexploitative relations associated with haciendas in the Yucatan Peninsula. Additionally, the reuse of these haciendas in the 20th century reminds us of the enduring effects of colonial land and labor arrangements as we hear stories of Maya communities migrating throughout the region, looking to reestablish land access and economic security.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Samantha&nbsp;Seyler</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230978771_IMG_5508--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230978771_IMG_5508--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Aguardiente Tank 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230978771_IMG_5508--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Aguardiente Tank 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team members taking measurements of a tank used for the production of aguardiente at Hacienda xCulumpich</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Seyler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Samantha&nbsp;Seyler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Aguardiente Tank 2022</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709232381726_DSC_0920--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709232381726_DSC_0920--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Week 2 Team Members, 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709232381726_DSC_0920--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Week 2 Team Members, 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team members in front of the principal house and water troughs at Hacienda San Jose xCafe</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Seyler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Samantha&nbsp;Seyler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Week 2 Team Members, 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709232266890_IMG_0450--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709232266890_IMG_0450--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Map xCafe 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709232266890_IMG_0450--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Map xCafe 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team members examining a map of Hacienda San Jose xCafe</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Seyler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Samantha&nbsp;Seyler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map xCafe 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230665834_IMG_0175--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230665834_IMG_0175--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Transit 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230665834_IMG_0175--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Transit 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team members using a transit to place stakes that will later be used for measuring and drawing architecture.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Seyler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Samantha&nbsp;Seyler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Transit 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230228280_IMG_7407--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230228280_IMG_7407--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Week 8 Team Members, 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141114/2141114_10773479_1709230228280_IMG_7407--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Week 8 Team Members, 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team members in front of the principal arch of Hacienda xCulumpich</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marcos Manzon Poot</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Samantha&nbsp;Seyler\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Week 8 Team Members, 2022</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
