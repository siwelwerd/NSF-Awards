 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eScience 2022 Conference is a premier international conference for presenting research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in data analytics and large-scale simulation and scientific discovery in general and distributed infrastructures more specifically. The conference brings together researchers, developers and users from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce to discuss recent advances and trends in many areas related to data analytics and distributed infrastructures.  The conference will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah, from October 11-14, 2022. The project will fund students to participate in the conference, to engage deeply with the eScience research community.  The eScience student participation program provides a comprehensive means for students to improve their overall research skills and career planning efforts, beyond presenting posters and papers.  The project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of scholars.\r\n\r\nThe student program committee for the conference is recruiting students with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and from a diverse set of institutions, with special emphasis on students from the southwestern mountain states of the U.S. that have computer science and engineering programs.  The conference will run specific student-centric sessions during the conference, including sessions on research presentation training, research career guidance, industry interaction, and a discussion with the authors of the best paper candidates from the conference.  While the project will enable funding a significant fraction of the students attending the conference, some students are presenting papers and posters at the conference and will be given priority for funding.  The funding provided by NSF will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of researchers in data analytics and distributed infrastructures, while encouraging diversity in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
