 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM) is one of the top-tier conferences in the field of data mining. It provides a venue for researchers who are addressing problems in data mining to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum.  The 2022 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2022) is being organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in cooperation with the American Statistical Association. SDM 2022 will be held in Alexandria, Virginia, USA from April 28 to April 30, 2022. Funds will provide travel support for approximately 30 graduate students from universities in the United States to  participate in a Ph.D. student forum that is to be held as part of SDM 2022.\r\n\r\nThe SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM) provides a venue for researchers who are addressing problems in data mining to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. Each student participant will be assigned a senior researcher to serve as a mentor on a variety of career-related issues and they also can attend the technical sessions, plenary talks, and tutorials and workshops at the conference to touch the frontier of data mining research. The student forum consists of a poster session for Ph.D. candidates in data mining or closely related areas or Ph.D. students who have made significant progress towards Ph.D. candidacy. The doctoral student forum participants will be able to present their work, interact with their peers from other universities as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. To enhance doctoral student participation and to recognize outstanding dissertation research in data mining being conducted by Ph.D. students, SDM 2022 will have awards for the best posters presented at the SDM 2022 Doctoral Student Forum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
