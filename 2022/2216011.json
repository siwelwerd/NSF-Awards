 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in computational methods that predict the structures of biological molecules enable the design of equally intricately structured polymers for their use in research, biotechnology, materials, and nanotechnology. Emerging artificial intelligence approaches amplify the power of the computational work and have increased demand for people with training in biomolecular structure computations. This project will provide to the trainees rigorous, interdisciplinary, collaborative research training in biomolecular structure prediction and design. Activities such as a code school, laboratory research and regular mentoring will afford training in the technical and communication skills necessary for success in STEM. Outreach to communities historically excluded from STEM will ensure that this growing field is accessible to a broad demographic.  The program will build a diverse STEM workforce, which is critically needed as artificial intelligence methods continue to dramatically impact the fields of molecular biology and bioengineering.\r\n \r\nBiomolecular computational structure research allows prediction of three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. The program will provide rigorous, interdisciplinary, collaborative research training in biomolecular structure prediction and design to eight post-baccalaureate trainees (\u201cparticipants\u201d) in each of three years. It will (1) develop post-baccalaureate participants' technical research skills and professional power skills, including communication and perseverance, with experiences that enhance participants\u2019 scientific identity, self-efficacy, and sense of belonging; (2) increase post-baccalaureate scholars\u2019 ease of transition into graduate level academic programs, in that they will be more prepared and supported when applying for and entering those programs, (3) create a tight knit network of mentors and mentees within the greater Rosetta Commons community through structured leadership training in improved mentoring; and (4) expand the pool of biomolecular graduate program applicants to include more individuals from backgrounds and communities historically excluded from STEM.\r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
