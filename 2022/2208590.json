 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transport in porous media occurs in a broad range of real world problems, e.g., CO2 sequestration and delivery of therapy agents to tumor sites. This project aims at development of robust and efficient numerical simulation toolboxes for such multi-scale multi-physics processes. This will enhance our understanding of these complicated phenomena and accordingly have further impact on better use of natural resources and cures for diseases. The project will also provide hands-on training opportunities for students.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is on design, analysis, implementation, and applications of a family of novel numerical methods for subdiffusive transport in poroelastic media. Novel finite element methods will be developed for approximating solid displacement, fluid pressure, and concentration of substance being transported. Conditions for stable coupling of sub-problem solvers will be investigated. These methods will be applied to simulations of drug delivery, tissue engineering, and reservoir engineering, and other similar multi-physics processes. These novel solvers will be implemented as C++ and Matlab code modules that are openly accessible to the scientific computing community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
