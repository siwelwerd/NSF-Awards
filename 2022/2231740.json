 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Division of Chemistry (CHE), Professors Gregory Herman, Liney Arnadottir, and Kelsey Stoerzinger of Oregon State University; Professor Tod Pascal of University of California-San Diego; and Dr. Ethan Crumlin of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are organizing a workshop to identify new frontiers in the use of ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) to study chemistry at surfaces and interfaces. APXPS methods would be combined with other x-ray-based methods and computational techniques to characterize the elemental, chemical, and electrical properties of the gas, liquid, and solid interfaces. The envisioned National Interface Science facility could advance our understanding of a broad array of physical and chemical phenomena taking place at surfaces and interfaces, many of which are central to problems facing society, including water purification, clean energy storage and generation, and waste remediation. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will engage thought-leaders from academic, industrial, and governmental sectors with expertise in multiple interdisciplinary areas, including electrochemistry, environmental and atmospheric chemistries, catalysis, biomaterials, and advanced manufacturing, laying the foundation for future experimentation in x-ray based interfacial methods. Participants will establish the instrumental and computational capabilities, as well as the multi-modal configurations needed to address an evolving set of scientific problems and enable transformational science. The integration of computation and experiment, as well as new advances in instrumentation, including the use of automation and artificial intelligence, will also be assessed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
