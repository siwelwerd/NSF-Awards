These scientists will have the opportunity to network, present, and collaborate with other scientists who are studying different geophysical techniques and methods to understand the processes happening at subduction zones. \r\n\r\nConvergent plate margins are important to further our understanding and imaging of, as these tectonic environments (1) host the largest and most destructive earthquakes and related tsunamis, as well as the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth and (2) are accompanied by large onshore/offshore basins that are suitable for geothermal and hydrocarbon natural resources. They also (3) represent natural laboratories to study fundamental cycles of the Earth System (e.g. carbon, water, etc.) and the fluid exchange between the Earth and the oceans. Convergent plate margins are one of the more challenging research environments due to their structural complexity and their dynamic evolution on geologically short time scales. Over the last decade, the development of geophysical imaging and monitoring techniques as well as numerical and laboratory modeling have been proven useful to unravel some of the complexity of subduction zone processes.  This funding will be used to aid early career scientists to travel to a conference focusing on these important topics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
