 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses poor long-term public health outcomes stemming from lifestyle choices through an intuitive and effective tool to analyze and optimize their sleep, exercise, nutrition, and mental health. The technology will guide users through an individualized health and well-being analysis based on real-time data that presents an individualized baseline and heat map that helps individuals determine which lifestyle behaviors are most beneficial or detrimental towards their holistic health. This personalized approach seeks to establish new habits, interventions, medications, diets, etc.  This tool may help people to live longer and more fulfilled lives with fewer health concerns and costs.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project determines the viability of objective measurement of health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, sleep cycles, and exercise) through the integration of already-existent technologies including, but not limited to, wearables and \u201csmart\u201d technologies such as Smart Scales and Smart Blood Pressure cuffs. Additionally, this project will determine the viability of using subjective inputs surrounding diet, mood, and exercise and the ability to draw meaningful correlations between both subjective and objective inputs. This project will develop and validate methods to integrate these two data streams into a health scoring system that may be used to improve physical and mental health and fitness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
