 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in reducing environmental impact of energy generation and improving the reliability of solar energy generation. Across all market segments, solar power accounted for 36% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first half of 2019. Utility-scale photovoltaic power maintained the largest share of installed capacity in the U.S. solar market but dust can affect power output. For example, the average losses due to surface contamination are about 7% in New York State, 15-25% in Arizona, and can go up to 100% during the dust storms in the Middle East and North Africa region. This project will develop a new cleaning method for solar panels.  It will significantly reduce Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), prevent potable water wastage, and save lost revenue due to solar panel cleaning. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes a new electrostatic method to restore the solar panel to 98% of its power capacity for a variety of soiling conditions. This technique will provide a new and efficient approach for cleaning the dust with negligible power consumption from solar panels itself without the need for an external power supply. This project integrates advances in laser-assisted manufacturing, modelling, thin-film solar panel manufacturing, photovoltaic panel testing, and large-scale installations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Utility-scale solar accounts for roughly 65% of total global solar capacity with the remaining 35% being residential and commercial installations. Worldwide desert-like installations are currently estimated to be 60% of the total utility scale solar at approximately 366.2 GW. Dust deposition to solar panels can reduce their output by more than 10%, with differential soiling further decreasing it by 25%. There have been no easy solutions to this problem to date. The standard approach is to mechanically clean solar panels, which use huge quantities of potable water and significant manual labor. As a result of the Phase 1 funding, our team has advanced scalability and performance of a new generation of electrodynamic field-based self-cleaning technology that repels dust particles and cleans solar panels. The intellectual merits include development of new manufacturing processes, computational and algorithmic advances that can deliver unprecedented, automated efficiency and scalability of this new dust removing approach.&nbsp; There are also outstanding broader impacts of this project. The societal benefits of preserving millions of gallons of potable water over the expected 25-year to 30-year operational life of a solar power plant are enormous. US solar power plants operating in desert-like regions are projected to grow to over 400 GW of grid capacity by 2033. If our technology is broadly adopted and promoted by major solar manufacturers over the next 10 years, it has the potential to obviate the need for over 60 billion gallons (over 184,000 acre-feet) of potable water, enormous transportation costs and logistics and substantial non-value-added labor. In these already parched desert-like regions potable water is a scarce commodity. Removing significant volumes of potable water from a local community already creates a strong divide between the Solar Power Plant operators and the local community.&nbsp; From a business perspective we have a critical third level of appeal to customers and end users.
