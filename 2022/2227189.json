This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study foundational topics related to programming languages and verification. The focus of this year's school is \"Types, Semantics, and Program Reasoning\". The significance and importance of the summer school include: instruction on how to build and reason about reliability and correctness of computing systems; building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas; and enhancing education of US students, including underrepresented minorities, by exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus train the next generation of researchers and practitioners in both industry and academia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
