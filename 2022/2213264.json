 "awd_abstract_narration": "This LEAPS-MPS project is funded by the Division of Chemistry to support Professor Twagirayezu and his group at Lamar University to study the effects of spatial molecular arrangement of long-chain fluorinated compounds on their chemical nature. Fluorinated compounds are functional human-made chemicals that, after release into the environment, exhibit helical coiling due to molecular deformation. Accurate analysis of helical coiling is extremely challenging and demands highly sensitive and precise measurement tools. The research addresses this challenge through experimental investigation and computational chemistry to determine the exact nature of helical coiling in fluorinated compounds. The results will provide insights that could be used for studying the dynamics of chiral molecules. The research program will promote research participation of college and high-school students from the underrepresented populations in the Southeast Texas Community. \r\n\r\nThis LEAPS-MPS award supports research on conformational studies of perfluorinated compounds and their chiral-targeted complexes. The selected compounds, i.e., perfluorooctanoic acids, are human-made pollutants exhibiting transient helical chirality due to molecular deformation. However, the accurate analysis of chiral systems requires fast, highly-sensitive, and precise measurement tools. This research project takes advantage of recent advances in quantum chemical calculations and molecular rotational spectroscopy to (i) determine the rotational signatures of perfluorinated compounds, (ii) decode dynamical information hidden in the observed rotational features, (iii) provide insights that facilitate the development of new analytical tools for fast measurements of chiral perfluorinated compounds. This award also supports the initiation of the SEED program to engage and encourage research participation of college and high-school students from the underrepresented populations in the Southeast Texas Community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
