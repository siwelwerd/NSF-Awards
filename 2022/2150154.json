 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University\u2019s (OSU) will host the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site called \u201cFrom the Upper Estuaries to the Deep Sea\u201d at the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) campus in Newport, Oregon. The REU program directly involves undergraduates in all aspects of marine science research from project inception to data collection, analysis, and interpretation, to presentation and publication of research results to both scientific and general audiences. HMSC will support cohorts of 16 interns, 10 traditional onsite and 6 new positions for remote-hybrid interns during a ten-week summer program that takes advantage of the wide range of marine science research opportunities available at HMSC and the experience successfully supporting remote and remote-hybrid interns during the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal is to develop an active inclusive community of students engaged in the interdisciplinary nature of marine science as a collective educational experience. \r\n  \r\nMajor objectives of the REU program are to: 1) provide students an opportunity for the highest quality research experience in marine science and an understanding of its interdisciplinary nature; 2) provide students with a professional development training opportunity and exposure to a wide range of marine science pathways leading to STEM careers; 3) increase participation in and access to marine sciences for traditionally under-represented students and nontraditional students through targeted recruitment efforts at regional community colleges and non-research universities serving underrepresented groups; and 4) adapt and learn from the successful support of a virtual cohort research experience during COVID-19 in summer of 2020 and 2021. Students will pursue research projects that fall within three major themes: Theme 1: Biology and Ecology of Marine and Estuarine Organisms; Theme 2: Ocean and Estuarine Ecology and Biogeochemistry; Theme 3: Physics of Estuarine and Ocean Environments: including projects in physical oceanography and estuarine science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
