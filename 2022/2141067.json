 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to increase dependable power generation from renewable energy resources and to improve the reliability and stability of the nation\u2019s electric power grid. Technical problems in connecting and controlling renewable energy resources have resulted in many large-scale failures and the interruption of energy production from these resources, jeopardizing the safe and reliable operation of the nation\u2019s electric power system. The proposed technology seeks to overcome the limitations of existing systems, increase reliability for connecting the inverter-based resources to the electric power grid, and allow more renewable energy to supply American homes and businesses. Attaining these goals will increase customer adoption of electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The technology may increase the competitiveness of US companies in the global inverter, artificial intelligence (AI), and renewable energy markets. The commercial impacts of the project are augmented by an educational outreach plan that will engage student researchers in engineering design problems that integrate and address business-relevant constraints and customer needs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to translate AI inverter control innovation into a commercial product, process, and/or service. There are two main gaps to overcome in the proposed project. One is a knowledge gap to extend the previous neural-network control technology to practical grid-following and grid-forming applications supporting the operation of inverter-based resources in grid-tied, islanded, and standalone conditions. The other gap is a technical barrier to move the proposed innovation out of the laboratory into real-world systems. Regarding the knowledge gap, research will equip the neural-network control innovation with modules that can support the inverter operation to meet various grid needs. Regarding the technical barrier, research will be performed in this project to enable the developed neural network inverter to satisfy the industry standards. The expected results include prototypes that can be applied to practical electric utility systems and AI-driven inverter technology that can meet strict reliability requirements of the electric power industry. The commercialization plan consists of a set of guided technology assessments and staged milestones with industry partners on commercial potential and business plan iteration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
