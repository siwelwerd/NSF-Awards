 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nWith support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program and co-funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. John Franck and his group at Syracuse University are developing instrumentation and associated software to routinely characterize the molecular-scale properties of the water that surrounds and permeates large molecules. This water plays an active role in all the processes that drive biological reactions and control bioinspired materials but remains relatively poorly characterized.  The new methodology is expected to greatly facilitate the difficult task of characterizing these unique water molecules and has begun to unlock a deeper understanding of the forces that bind small molecule ligands to their macromolecular targets and polymers and proteins to each other. Dissemination of the methodology will speed the design and development of new drugs and materials, with potential impacts in areas such as cancer treatment and energy harvesting. Talented diverse students recruited to engage in this research will learn about the possibilities of employing modern technology and programming to build new types of chemical characterization tools.  The work will provide unique open-source data-processing libraries for public use. \r\n\r\nHydration water controls far-ranging properties of macromolecules, from the shapes they adopt to the energetics and kinetics of important binding events. Because any type of binding interaction or any conformational fluctuation that determines the final folded structure of a protein or synthetic polymer must necessarily displace hundreds of water molecules, the properties of those water molecules crucially determine the relevant kinetics and thermodynamics. Much that currently remains poorly understood or difficult to predict about protein-protein binding and the interactions of synthetic polymers and solvents can be attributed to an inability to characterize the hydration water molecules, which are known to have dramatically different properties from the bulk solvent. The liquid-state ODNP (Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization) techniques being developed offer a new angle of attack for revealing the properties of hydration water by tracking the motion of the nuclear centers of water relative to a chemically placed target moiety (known as the spin probe) and offering a site-specific measurement that can be directly related to fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques are being developed and used to elucidate the connection between nanometer-scale variations in hydration dynamics and the thermodynamic barriers that govern macromolecular interactions, thereby clarifying the contributions of water molecules moving on different timescales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
