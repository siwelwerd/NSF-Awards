 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Chicago Botanic Garden, located in Glencoe, IL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during each summer of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. This award aims to increase the number of people working in botany-related professions, which is necessary for addressing current conservation challenges. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through a standardized survey and students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThis program has three primary goals: (1) provide research experiences that deliver foundational knowledge and skills for a career in plant conservation, (2) inspire new researchers while engaging with audiences within and beyond the scientific community, and (3) provide students and mentors with skills and experiences that nurture productive and empowering relationships. Prospective students apply through a web-based portal developed specifically for this program. Research takes place at the Chicago Botanic Garden\u2019s Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation Science and Action and nearby field sites. Projects range from investigating the use of native plants as lawn alternatives, to understanding urban plant diversity, and determining the genetic diversity of plant collections and its role in restoration. Students will be provided with extensive professional development. Weekly 3-hour sessions will develop skills in field-biology, data analysis and visualization, and conservation genetics, as well as workshops that will provide guidance on applying to graduate school, science communication, ethics, and more. The program culminates in a symposium where participants present research posters, and an informal event in which student-produced videos are presented. More information about the program is available by visiting https://pbcinternships.org or by contacting the PI (Dr. Norman Wickett at nwickett@chicagobotanic.org) or the co-PI (Dr. Jeremie Fant at jfant@chicagobotanic.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
