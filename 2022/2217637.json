 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to form a diverse research team, plan corresponding activities, and develop research tasks at Florida A&M University (FAMU), an Historically Black College and University, aimed at conducting research on brain-inspired dynamics for engineering energy-efficient circuits and artificial intelligence. The proposed research plan will leverage the expertise in various fields to develop brain inspired intelligence distributing high efficiency RF signal processing circuits which can be applied to 5G/6G wideband wireless communication, IoT, national security, radar, quantum computing, smart city, and smart health etc. The planning grant activities will catalyze the inclusion of all traditionally under-served populations in engineering in future U.S. engineering workforce development and research innovation. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on forming a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in neuroscience, wireless communication, signal processing, high frequency circuit and system design, and novel material design. Planning grant activities that will be carried out during the project period include 1) organize multiple workshops, inviting speakers in different fields from internal or outside of primary institution; 2) structured mentoring the PI in the execution of forming diverse research teams; 3) directed activities to overcome the challenge of geographic distance in collaborative activities; 4) develop the research plan and tasks through coordinating with experts in varied fields; 5) promote minority, women, and underrepresented students to develop their STEM careers. The planning activities in this project will significantly enhance the capability and capacity of FAMU to participate in and lead mid-scale research projects exploring transformative research ideas that address national grand challenges and societal needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
