 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nWhile fire is an important ecological process in the western United States, wildfire has increased over recent decades as a result of climate change, historical fire suppression, and lack of adequate fuels management. Due to the urgency to protect life and property, this work will use state-of-the-art technology (ground-based lasers) to collect information about forests that will help inform and support both forest health management and active fire operations in California. In addition, research findings related to wildfire will be used to create virtual reality-based activities that will be used to improve retention and graduation rates of underrepresented minorities in STEM majors at a primarily undergraduate, Hispanic Serving Institution. These novel data-driven and accessible educational products will also be presented at a local nature preserve and for 4th-6th graders at a Spanish-immersion school to allow broad audiences to better understand interactions between forests and wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: 1) Use terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and handheld mobile laser scanning to estimate understory forest structure parameters, determine impacts of forest structure on past wildfire intensity, and predict how altered forest structure affects future wildfire risk; and 2) Link temporal changes in net primary productivity to disturbance via a scaling model parameterized with TLS-collected biomass, measured leaf traits and climate data. This work also aims to use research findings related to wildfire to expand opportunities for a more diverse group of students, many of whom are often underrepresented minorities or first-generation college students. This will be accomplished through: 1) Mentoring underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students to create a virtual \"field trip\" focused on forest structure for an ecology course-based undergraduate research experience and NSF-funded \"The Virtual Field\" platform; and 2) Adapting the \u201cfield trip\u201d for public outreach at a local nature preserve and for 4th-6th graders at a Spanish-immersion school using virtual reality (VR). Data collected will enable crucial characterization of ecosystem changes post-wildfire and assessment of forest sensitivity to cumulative disturbances and advance the predictability of ecological science. In addition, VR activities will broaden participation in field learning and expand opportunities for a more diverse group of students, especially during pandemic times.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
