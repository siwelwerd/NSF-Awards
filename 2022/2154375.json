 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Pingyun Feng of the University of California, Riverside is studying the development of new electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This process is a critical electrochemical reaction in green energy applications, including water-splitting, to produce clean fuels. The OER also plays an important role in applications such as rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Professor Feng and her team are studying the fundamental interactions in metal chalcogenide frameworks that support sustainable earth-abundant OER catalysts and can tune their reactivity. This work is contributing to the development of next-generation technologies for sustainable and renewable energy by replacing precious metal catalysts and determining how to achieve OER at low potential and high efficiency. Simultaneously, Professor Feng is supporting undergraduate research opportunities and undergraduate education in chemical careers, as well as developing a new course in solid state inorganic materials chemistry.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, Professor Feng and her research group will develop host-guest inclusion chemistry in metal chalcogenide materials that integrate uniform porosity, high surface area, and semiconductivity to support transition metal (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles that function as efficient electrocatalysts for OER. Incorporated nanoparticles will be prepared with controllable sizes using the confinement effect of the metal chalcogenide nanoporous host. The diverse chemical composition, structural flexibility and morphology of the nano-structured host-guest materials provide a platform for the fundamental systematic study of their electrocatalytic properties for OER. The research program integrates synthetic design and execution with characterization of the physical and chemical nature of the new materials, and their testing for electrocatalytic performance. These activities also support the cross-disciplinary training of both undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds to prepare them for challenging and rewarding careers in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
