 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma processing is a key technology in both well-established industries (semiconductor processing, LED lighting) and in emerging applications (pharmaceutical manufacturing, energy conversion technologies, agriculture). The common thread that runs through these manufacturing processes is the interaction between a plasma and the surface it modifies, with the range of surfaces under investigation by the plasma community continuously increasing in variety. Plasmas are now being used to process not only inorganic materials, but also polymers, biopolymers, living tissue, low-dimensional materials such as catalyst nanoparticles, liquids, and liquid droplets. The 2022 Gordon Research Conference on Plasma Processing Science (GRC-PPS) will be held July 24-29, 2022, at the Proctor Academy, Andover, NH to provide a unique environment for scientists to discuss the unresolved issues in plasma-matter interaction. The meeting will bring together experts in all areas related to plasma processing science, covering theory, experimental methods, and advanced characterization techniques. The conference will bring together leaders in the field, early-career investigators including postdocs, and graduate students. While most of the talks will be given by invited speakers, selected contributions from attendees will be included in the program. The Gordon Research Seminar, which will take place immediately before the conference, will provide a venue for early career researchers to present and discuss their research. Gordon Conferences provide ample time for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, providing a constructive atmosphere for brainstorming and creative thinking among the attendees.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 Gordon Research Conference on Plasma Processing Science (GRC-PPS) \u201cPlasmas and Their Interaction with Matter\u201d consists of nine sessions covering a broad range of topics, from plasma-liquid interfaces to synthesis of novel materials and plasma-driven catalysis. While the conference theme is the same as 2018 GRC-PPS, only two of the sessions of the 2022 meeting overlap with those offered in 2018 \u2013 the choice to revisit these topics was motivated by the continued relevance of plasma-driven materials synthesis and rapidly increasing interest in plasma catalysis. The 2022 GRC-PPS will highlight that the range of surfaces under investigation by the plasma community is continuously increasing, providing new challenges and opportunities to this broad discipline. This conference will bring together experts in all aspects of plasma science, including theory, experimental methods, and advanced characterization techniques. This conference and the associated Gordon Research Seminar will provide an informal venue for discussing the most pressing scientific issues in plasma processing science, facilitating the exchange of ideas and establishing new collaborations. The societal contributions of plasma processing science emerged with the development of modern semiconductor device manufacturing etch processes, which in turn has enabled the information technology revolution. Plasma processing science now encompasses applications in energy storage and conversion, catalysis, medical treatment technologies, and biomass and polymer conversion processes, underscoring the potential positive impact of the GRC meeting on society. Moreover, representatives at all career stages, from recognized leaders to graduate students, will have an opportunity to share their insights into the most pressing issues in plasma science. International participants with affiliations beyond academia will actively contribute to this meeting. The conference organizers are committed to reaching out to potential participants from underrepresented groups. The program includes a Power Hour, designed to support the professional growth of women in the scientific community. Moreover, the GR Seminar will provide unique training, mentoring, and networking opportunities to early-stage researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
