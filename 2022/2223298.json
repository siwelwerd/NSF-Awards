 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers, including invited speakers, recent Ph.D. recipients, and graduate students, in the international workshop \"Practical and Structural Model Theory\" held at the University of Leeds, UK, July 25-29, 2022.  The model-theoretic notion of o-minimality was developed around 40 years ago and has had considerable impact in several parts of mathematics. This meeting is devoted to o-minimality in all its aspects and provides a unique opportunity for graduate students and beginning researchers to get involved with, and contribute to, this exciting area.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty leading researchers will present invited talks at the workshop, covering three general themes: (i) the model theory of o-minimal structures and theories, including the classification of definable groups, (ii) applications of o-minimality, including to algebraic and Diophantine geometry, and (iii) generalizations of o-minimality, including NIP theories, distality, and applications to combinatorics. \r\n\r\nThe conference website is https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtpe/PS/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
