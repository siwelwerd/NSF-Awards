 "awd_abstract_narration": "The state of Wisconsin is diversifying its energy portfolio with the addition of wind and solar power generation, while some fossil fuel plants are retired.  Lakeshore Technical College (LTC) is the only technical college provider of wind energy education in the state, and this project will transform individuals to strengthen their communities through innovative and accessible learning.  Through the Advanced Renewable Energy Technician Education project, LTC will address the skills gaps and unmet demand for renewable energy technicians in Wisconsin.  Working with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) they will identify opportunities to implement training in solar and/or energy storage that would augment an existing wind energy program.  The strategy of including additional credentials in other energy dependent trainings, such as HVAC, will increase the number of students that are prepared to interact with the growing and evolving renewable energy sector.  The goals of the program are to (1) establish a renewable energy BILT to address entry level employment skills and workforce gaps that can be addressed by LTC, (2) develop solar energy instructional labs and provide professional development for faculty to support enhanced renewable energy offerings, and (3) develop learner-focused and culturally responsive curriculum to attract and produce renewable energy technicians that are representative of the diversity of LTC\u2019s service area.\r\n\r\nThe BILT will work with LTC to conduct a gap analysis and determine the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for solar and energy storage technicians.  When changes are made, an external evaluator will assess industry satisfaction and student learning within the renewable energy educational offerings.  Faculty professional development will take place through various trainings that will prepare instructors to integrate new laboratory equipment into their courses.  To increase enrollment and awareness of the revised program, LTC will offer teacher training workshops to prepare high school faculty to teach renewable energy and prepare students to transfer into LTC\u2019s program.  An external evaluator will measure the progress towards their goals.  LTC will disseminate their findings through regional and national meetings, in collaboration with the ATE CREATE Energy Center which includes more than 900 faculty nationwide.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
