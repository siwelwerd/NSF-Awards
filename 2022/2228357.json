The conference is focused on discussing state-of-the-art in ultrahigh temperature ceramic (UHTC) processing, characterization and properties. Given the renewed interest in this field the meeting is very timely and relevant to the ceramics scientific community and plays an important role of research dissemination and fostering scientific collaboration. It provides an ideal environment for junior scientists and engineers to become integrated into the field. Support from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research enables supporting up to five individuals that are either graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, or early career individuals. Particular attention to supporting individuals from groups that are historically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines is achieved through this travel participant/registration award.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nUltra-High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs) - which includes transition metal carbides, nitrides, and borides - are a family of compounds that display a unique set of properties, including extremely high melting temperatures (>3000 deg. C), high hardness and good chemical stability and strength at high temperatures. The combination of properties makes these materials candidates for a variety of high-temperature structural applications, including engines, high-speed vehicles, plasma arc electrodes, cutting tools, and advanced nuclear fuel usages. The conference\u2019s focus on the scientific status of UHTC and the ability for leading experts to share their developments will ensure a continuation of new ideas and nurture collaborations that provide distinct advancements in a class that are ever more relevant to meet the demands placed on materials in extreme environments. The travel award is used to enable graduate, post docs, and/or early professionals, particularly those from underrepresented demographics in STEM, to participate in the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
