 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of anthropogenic activities and their associated environmental pollutants are now considered a major contributor to population declines in wild species. As of 2020, the world had lost an estimated two-thirds of its animal populations, constituting a sixth global mass extinction event. Despite growing awareness of the consequences of air pollution on human health, there is little understanding of how airborne particulate matter affects non-human populations. The respiratory anatomy of avian species makes them uniquely susceptible to airborne particulates; songbirds can therefore serve as a sentinel species for ecosystem-wide air pollution concerns. The overall objective of this project is to characterize how the nanosized fraction of particulate matter in air pollution affects both the physiology and behavior of exposed organisms, in particular birds. While addressing this scientific goal, 4 undergraduate researchers per year will oversee all data collection. In addition, the research students and PIs will also partner with ExploreHope, an existing on-campus outreach program, to develop and lead a weeklong summer camp titled, Angry bird origins: How pollution affects avian communities. This camp will provide scholarships for 15 local K-12 students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds per year to help foster relationships between the local community, K-12 students, and undergraduate researchers with the ultimate goal of increasing the retention of diverse students in STEM. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on experimentally investigating the impact of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) on a songbird model, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). House sparrows are an ideal model organism because they inhabit human dominated areas and could be particularly susceptible to airborne pollution. IONPs are one of the main components of the particulate matter fraction in air pollution. The overarching hypothesis is IONP exposure will disrupt the organism\u2019s behavior by either detrimentally affecting auditory sensory processing and/or through bioaccumulation of nanoparticles. The first objective is to test the prediction that IONP exposure decreases hearing sensitivity. Wild-caught birds will be assigned into either a control or treatment group and will undergo a pre- and post-exposure auditory tests. Preliminary data suggests that IONP exposure detrimentally effects hearing thresholds. The second objective is to test the prediction that IONP exposure alters species-relevant behaviors. Behavioral tests after IONPs exposure will assess changes in foraging and the anti-predator response. These behaviors are biologically relevant and linked to biological fitness. The third objective is to localize and quantify the accumulation of IONPs in relevant organs. We will assess the organ bioaccumulation of IONPs via inductively coupled plasma (ICP). This interdisciplinary work will span the biology and chemistry departments at Hope College, a research-driven undergraduate institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
