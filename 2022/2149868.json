 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following the genome revolution, bioinformatics has arisen as an essential field of research. There is a critical need for scientists with interdisciplinary training to process and analyze large scale genomic datasets. This new REU Site establishes a program called BRIDGE (Bioinformatics Research In Data science for Genomics) that exposes students to research within bioinformatics and computational biology. Ten students will receive training and mentorship for ten weeks each summer and will be jointly advised by members of the UMD Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CBCB).\r\nThroughout this experience, students will work in pairs to learn about a research problem, propose a plan to tackle a specific research question, and implement their plan. With the guidance of experienced mentors, undergraduate students will research real world problems in cutting-edge areas of bioinformatics, including metagenomics, machine learning, single-cell  RNA sequencing, parallel  computing, and phylogenomics. Students will address novel problems with unknown answers. By the end  of the summer, each team will produce a paper and give an oral presentation on their project.  Students' findings will advance knowledge and understanding of the field.\r\nBRIDGE aims to build a diverse cohort of exceptional undergraduates from across the country and  provide research opportunities for women, underrepresented minorities, and non-traditional students. In order to build a solid foundation in bioinformatics and computational biology, students will take a week-long intensive course and attend seminars and panel discussions on various professional development topics. BRIDGE will provide students with a valuable, enjoyable research experience that will encourage them to pursue interdisciplinary graduate studies and eventually expand and diversify the biomedical research field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
