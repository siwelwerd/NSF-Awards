 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the complex and interwoven effects of changing climate and land use on hydrology is necessary to manage water resources. The Great Lakes Basin (GLB), the world\u2019s largest surface freshwater resource, has experienced dramatic shifts in lake levels from record lows to record highs over the last decade. Despite over a century of lake level measurements, we do not fully understand what drives such fluctuations in Great Lakes levels. One reason is that the basin\u2019s extensive groundwater resources are poorly monitored, and often ignored in models. Here, we propose to develop a hydrologic model that more accurately simulates both surface and groundwater flows, driven by and validated using data from both ground GPS instruments and satellites. This model will provide an unprecedented view of how groundwater, the \u201csixth Great Lake\u201d, affects lake levels across the GLB. \r\n\r\nWe propose a fusion of hydrologic modeling with GPS, InSAR, satellite imagery, and GRACE data to more accurately simulate surface and subsurface flows in the GLB. This will be the first such integration of geodesy (deformation and gravity change), measurements of groundwater-coupled surface water extent from remote sensing, and integrated hydrologic modeling. Through data assimilation, we will produce both historical and nowcast groundwater flow and storage reanalysis products to reveal the spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater across the basin, and relate this to fluctuating lake levels. This will provide reliable information about surface and groundwater storage, lake levels, and flow rates that are needed for water resource management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
