 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the geographic range and movement of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti in arid desert environments. Arid environments are of increasing attention for mosquito control as Ae. aegypti has recently and rapidly expanded into these arid environments. Ae. aegypti mosquitoes transmit dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. This project sequences and analyzes the entire mitochondrial genome using phylogenetic techniques and couples these data with a spatially explicit analysis of phylogenetic patterns over two seasons. This analysis contributes to an understanding of which local conditions result in source populations and high individual counts. A more complete understanding of the underlying geographic distribution and movement of Ae. aegypti in arid desert environments is beneficial to vector control and public health efforts as this mosquito continues to expand its range and outbreaks of disease occur. This understanding supports public health interventions to be targeted efficiently and effectively to those at greatest risk by establishing a \u201crange of risk\u201d for Ae. aegypti-borne diseases.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to utilize whole mitochondrial genome sequencing of mosquito pools collected over two mosquito seasons to better understand the movement of the vector within this area, as well as any potential source locations of the mosquito population. Researchers will work with public health officials to procure geo-located mosquito samples from 2019 and 2020. Data will be sequenced and analyzed to produce the entire mitochondrial genome using various phylogenetic and phylogeographic techniques. This project develops an understanding of the geographic distribution and movement of Ae. aegypti and identifies potential source locations for the mosquito population in arid environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Recently identified cases of locally-acquired dengue fever have sparked concern about viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti being imported to Maricopa County, an area with over 4.5 million residents, most of whom are na&iuml;ve to viruses transmitted by this mosquito. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on the phylogenetic structure of Ae. Aegypti populations by providing the first collection of 94 mitochondrial genome sequences from the Maricopa County, Arizona population of the mosquito after its recent population expansion in this region. We are in the process of submitting these genomes to Genbank. We employed phylogeographic techniques to investigate the spatial distribution and movement of the mosquito vector of interest in Maricopa County.<br />INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Aedes aegypti has historically been thought to have a very small range (about 100-200m), so we expected to find a strong relationship between sampling location and genetic similarity. Surprisingly, no distinct clades related to geographic location were identified, and we found no relationship between geographic distance and genetic distance.<br />BROADER IMPACTS: Our findings suggest that Aedes aegypti population mixture exists throughout the county regardless of geographic distance which has implications for vector control and public health practice in this region. Importantly, this is the first study of its kind in this region, so additional resolution may be achieved as additional samples are sequenced.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/18/2024<br>\nModified by: Crystal&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hepp</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2210879/2210879_10825065_1731959298759_AedesTrapLocations--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2210879/2210879_10825065_1731959298759_AedesTrapLocations--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"30 trap sites that Aedes aegypti were collected at\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2210879/2210879_10825065_1731959298759_AedesTrapLocations--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"30 trap sites that Aedes aegypti were collected at\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Location of 30 traps from which Aedes aegypti mitochondrial genome samples were sequenced.
