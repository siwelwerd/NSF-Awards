 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of a custom next-generation Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope Instrument, capable of performing combined Atomic Force Microscopy as well as the complementary spectroscopic techniques of infrared and Tip-Enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Compared to existing systems, this instrument provides extremely high detection sensitivity and resolution on sample volume approximately a billion times smaller than that of traditional microscopic tools using wavelengths in the visible to mid-infrared. This results in approximately a one-billion-fold increase in sensitivity while the spatial resolution is improved by a factor of 100 to 10000 of magnitude. Housed at the University of Central Florida, the instrument will provide multi-disciplinary researchers within the region access to novel in-depth analyses of materials, components, and devices critical to expanding the understanding of material performance in a range of cutting-edge research and educational programs. The instrument synergistically complements research strengths and collaborations across UCF science and engineering by offering unprecedented access to new spatial, spectral, and temporal domains, supporting a diverse range of research areas including biological studies, plasmonic surface interactions, photovoltaics, polymers, inorganic optical materials, semiconductor devices, sensors, and more. UCF is federally recognized as a Hispanic serving institution, and with over 70,000 students, UCF is among the largest R1 universities in the United States. This instrument will enable unique training, research, and mentoring opportunities that give students hands-on experience and cutting-edge skills. Several classes currently offered at UCF on surface science, nanotechnology, optical materials science, spectroscopy, and even astrobiology will directly benefit by incorporating content-specific material from this state-of-the-art instrument. \r\n \r\nThis research enables the acquisition of a next-generation Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope (neaSNOM), configured by the team and custom-built by Neaspec to perform simultaneous Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and nanoscale (10 nm spatial resolution) Fourier Transform infrared (nanoFTIR) and Tip-Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (nanoTERS). Uniquely, the neaSNOM instrument can analyze the same 10-nm spot with nanoFTIR and nanoTERS, enabling simultaneous hyperspectral mapping via two complementary techniques. The system is modular and easily reconfigured to accommodate user-defined light-sources, detectors, pump-probe studies from THz to near-UV wavelengths, and photoluminescence studies. The instrument synergistically complements research strengths and collaborations across UCF science and engineering by offering unprecedented access to new spatial, spectral, and temporal domains, supporting a diverse range of research areas including planetary science, biological studies, plasmonic surface interactions, photovoltaics, polymers, inorganic optical materials, semiconductor devices, sensors, ultrafast spectroscopy, and more.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
