 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project will be in developing a wearable medical device as a new solution for patients with lymphedema, a condition in which fluid build up causes swelling, especially in the arms or legs.  The device will improve the body fluid circulation while significantly reducing the risk of severe complications associated with this disease. The goal is to address health disparities and to improve the overall health outcomes of patients suffering from lymphedema. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project focuses on developing an emerging medical technology to address lymphedema, which is a major public health issue in the United States. Lymphedema is characterized by chronic swelling of a body part which has debilitating effects and negatively impacts the quality of life of the patient. A compact, wearable, and simple to operate medical device will be built that will apply therapeutic pressure gradients with the goal of improving lymphatic flow.  This technology may significantly enhance current therapeutic modalities when compared to compressive methods that use pneumatic pressure to squeeze out lymph fluid.  The proposed technology will have two key mechanical elements: the patch and the controller, designed in a way to mimic the manual lymph drainage techniques. The technology may enhance current therapeutic clinical modalities and be extended to home-based therapies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
