 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop a highly-efficient manufacturing process for production of lightweight titanium alloy in thin gauge formats. Conventional multistage flat and pack rolling processes for titanium, although mature and large-scale, are highly energy-intensive, with large emissions, and costly infrastructure. This project will produce sheet, foil and wire formats in a single step, with novel mechanical property combinations of higher strength and formability not achievable by current sheet rolling processes. The property combinations are expected to enable improved structural performance and lightweight materials for the aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors. The machining-based processing will provide a sustainable manufacturing system for sheet, foil and wire from a range of commercial lightweight alloys such as titanium, aluminum and magnesium. Importantly, the new process requires lower energy (> 50% reduction) and compact infrastructure compared to current rolling facilities. The Partnership will also contribute to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in innovation, and positively impact engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will provide a new energy-efficient process alternative to current multistage rolling processes characterized by large energy usage and emissions, and high cost. To realize this goal, the project will address three objectives. First, hybrid-machining process parameters will be optimized by systematic study of how deformation plasticity conditions influence sheet-metal structure and properties. Second, process attributes will be characterized in terms of product quality (surface finish, properties), process energy, and production rate and cost. Last, by integrating the results, a systems framework will be defined in a pre-commercial production process for titanium and titanium alloy foil/sheet formats. The manufacturing benefits will be quantified in terms of process energy savings, material property enhancements, production cost, and applicability to varied material systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The process combines simultaneous cutting and extrusion (at the point of cutting) to &ldquo;peel off&rdquo; layers of material from the ingot. Metal alloy sheet and foil produced by this method include titanium, aluminum, electrical steels and copper. Unique attributes of the sheet and foil include fine-grained microstructures and crystallographic shear textures of high formability, all effected by process deformation control. The control parameters that can be systematically varied in this process during sheet production include speed, strain and strain rate &ndash; the parameters that are known to control material microstructure and mechanical properties. Such control of deformation parameters is difficult if not impossible to achieve by commercial rolling and drawing processes, the common methods currently used to produce sheet, foil and wire.</p>\r\n<p>We have shown that the mechanical properties of the various metal alloy sheet/foil are similar to those of conventional rolled sheet; the surface quality of these bulk forms is equivalent or superior to conventional sheet metals; and ultrafine-grained microstructures, including nanostructured metals, can be produced by this process by fine control of the deformation conditions. A deformation process-microstructure-properties map has been completed for titanium, which will enable optimization of the process conditions for sheet quality and properties&rsquo; control. Scaling of the HCE process to produce sheet/foil of up to 100 mm width, and 0.1 to 1.5 mm thickness has been demonstrated with model copper and electrical steel material systems. A demonstration of lithium foil production, with foil thickness of 10 to 200 micrometers, has also been accomplished; such foils are of emerging interest for battery anodes. The Li work was featured as a Journal cover article. An energy analysis procedure has been developed and implemented to estimate HCE and rolling process energy for sheet and foil production. The analysis shows that sheet production by the single-step HCE requires only half as much energy as multi-step rolling (usually 10 to 30 steps), because of the large reduction in the number of deformation steps. A new applications domain for machining processes - materials manufacturing &ndash; is emerging.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A pre-commercial prototype version of the process for sheet and foil production is under development in collaboration with the PFI industry partner M4 Sciences, and a world-leading carbide tool manufacturer, Seco Tools. We anticipate that, when fully developed and scaled, the HCE process will be applicable to a broad range of structural alloys of low-density like titanium and aluminum, and alloys of interest to electrical power generation such as high-silicon content electrical steels and lithium.</p>\r\n<p>The project team greatly benefited from participation in the NSF I-Corps Mid-Atlantic Winter 2024 Cohort (March-April).

Weekly meetings with instructors (experienced deep-tech entrepreneurs, investors) provided guidance on effective communication strategies to gather meaningful insights from the interviews. The team also attended two industry-related conferences (AeroMat 2024 and Sea-Air-Space 2024) and visited two manufacturing plants (Wabash National, REA Wire) during the workshop. As a result of the this program, the team was also able to better identify the value chain in the manufacturing of sheet and foil and develop a strategy for market entry.
