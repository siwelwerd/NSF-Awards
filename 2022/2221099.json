 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Norfolk State University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). Over its 4 year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 29 unique full time  students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering. The Future Leaders and Movers in Engineering and Computer Science (FLAME) program seeks to establish a learning community of academically talented and financially eligible students. FLAME Scholars will be first year and transfer students and will receive funding for up to four years. FLAME will expose these scholars to a comprehensive set of activities to enhance their preparation for successful careers in business and industrial settings. The program design integrates formal and informal experiences and emphasizes leadership, experiential learning, and self-identification as a scientist or engineer. A thoughtful plan for assessment and review will ensure effective course adjustment and overall evaluation of the program components. FLAME seeks to integrate program features, such as a Leadership Seminar Series, Technical Workshops, Distinguished Lecture Series, and social bonding events. Successful completion is expected to demonstrate effective pathways of broadened opportunity and participation in STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. A key project outcome is that the proposed program should exceed NSU's overall retention to graduation rate. In addition, to ensure scholars' persistence, FLAME aims to provide role model mentoring (from faculty, community, and industry partners) and professional development for the scholars to enter the computing-related workforce or advanced study. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
