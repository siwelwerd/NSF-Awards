 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) is a critical part of the product development cycle in any manufacturing field. The idea behind DFMA is to design parts in a way that allows them to be easily manufactured. If an individual is designing parts with no understanding of what will be required to produce those parts, product flaws and costly redesigns can arise. Focusing on design optimization reduces the cost of manufacturing and is therefore critical to any manufacturing company. Regional stakeholders indicated the need for employees with experience in DFMA. To help regional stakeholders\u2019 need for employees with knowledge of DFMA, Chippewa Valley Technical College (CVTC) will work with industry partners to develop Project Based Learning (PBL) activities that will provide secondary and post-secondary students opportunities to solve real-life DFMA problems. The project will leverage the CVTC Prototype Lab, developed through a previous NSF Advanced Technological Education award, to provide students and community members a space to take their designs from concept to reality. Increasing opportunities to experience the complex field of manufacturing through hands-on, contextualized problems will lead to increased enrollment in related post-secondary programs and subsequent entry into high-demand, high-skilled manufacturing careers. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: (1) prepare technicians for manufacturing and engineering through applied education of DFMA processes and concepts, and (2) increase the capacity of rural secondary teachers to provide instruction in DFMA. Through completion of PBL activities and design workshops, students will demonstrate mastery of core competencies related to DFMA. PBL activities will be developed with direct assistance from industry partners and incorporated into various courses throughout the Mechanical Design Technology and Manufacturing Engineering Technologist programs. PBL activities will focus on a variety of topics, including simple machines, tool design, mechanisms, robotic tools, and surface design. During capstone experiences, post-secondary students will engage directly with industry partners as they respond to real-world business problems related to DFMA. Introduction at the secondary level will involve incorporation of PBL activities into several courses and a regional design competition. Specific professional development and mentoring geared toward high school faculty will benefit future students for years to come. The project will include evaluation by an external expert. Results of this evaluation could inform other institutions about effective approaches to recruiting and educating technicians for DFMA jobs. In addition, via an interactive website, project partners and community members will be kept apprised of project progress and success. This website will also provide a place for other institutions to access the PBL activities developed. The CVTC Prototype Lab will continue to provide a space to inspire makers and entrepreneurs from the community to turn their ideas into new products, creating a culture of innovation and invention in the Chippewa Valley. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
