 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to improve connectivity for everyone by enabling widespread 5G cellular phone coverage at significantly lower costs and substantial energy savings. The proposed technology may result in accelerated 5G deployment and ubiquitous 5G availability in both urban and rural areas. This coverage will have positive impacts, bridging the digital divide across different geographical areas of the US and across different socioeconomic groups, by bringing new opportunities for telework, tele-education, telehealth, and telemedicine to traditionally un- and under-served communities. The technological innovation of this project may allow mid-band and high-band cellular signals to be carried over existing twisted-pair copper wires, as well as coaxial cables, optical fibers, and Ethernet wires, to enable the delivery of 5G-based services across barriers that signals delivered over the air from a tower cannot penetrate. The technology developed in this project will reuse the existing wireline infrastructure and reduce the need for deployment of more cellular towers, providing a more environmentally-friendly solution.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to the problem of extending 5G cellular coverage to the interior of homes and buildings. The proposed project seeks to address critical technical issues related to the overall feasibility and performance potential of the cellular subscriber line (CSL) technology, as well as the corresponding high-level deployment guidelines. These issues will be resolved through the development of a detailed simulation platform, the design and development of network-side and customer-side prototype units using existing radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components, including the protocol for communication between the two units, and the validation of the technology though testing of the prototype units in the laboratory of a major wireless carrier.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nConnectivity is not just about connecting devices; rather, it is about connecting humans &ndash; enabling all of us to communicate in real time, without limits of infrastructure, and to get business done while sharing information securely. Innovation requires broader, faster connectivity that depends on higher frequencies. However, higher frequencies are limited in their ability to travel through physical and environmental barriers reducing the number of people and devices that connect to a system. Addressing this problem cost effectively is paramount and is the problem that PHYTunes was founded to solve. \n\n\nThe driving principle at PHYTunes is to develop a truly convergent network at the customer's edge that can deliver high-frequency cellular signals to places that cannot be cost-effectively served with existing technologies.  \n\n\nThe proposed concept in this project is to leverage and increase the value of the already existing wireline infrastructure built over many decades and to deliver an exceptional communication experience for the end user with a 10X reduction in cost, increased security, and a 10X reduction in power requirements with a corresponding increase in environmental friendliness.  \n\n\nThe key features of the proposed concept are as follows: (i) it carries wireless signals over wireline connections to bypass building structures (walls, windows, etc.), thereby eliminating the high attenuation loss that wireless signals experience when trying to penetrate such structures, and (ii) it is transparent to the existing wireless infrastructure, extending the coverage by incorporating low-cost solutions that take advantage of the technology built into the current wireless networks. PHYTunes proposes the use of ultra-low-latency wireline connections built with low-cost intermediate frequency head end unit and radio frequency satellite units. \n\n\nPHYTunes conducted research into the technical feasibility of the proposed solution by developing various simulation models, various protocols and further developed a prototype using the available hardware components like Field Programmable&#8239;Gate Arrays (FGPAs) and Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs). As part of Phase I research, PHYTunes was able to dig deeper into the technical details and found several missing pieces that were needed to make the proposed solution work. This research work not only helped build the prototype, but several implementation designs/ideas were developed and patented. \n\n\nThe prototypes developed and to be developed PHYTunes products will help bring the industry closer to the goal of having ubiquitous high frequency 5G coverage indoors with significantly lower cost and much easier deployment. The state of innovation in the US and around the world in 5G has been curtailed by issues associated with high-frequency signal propagation which has led to poor coverage. By developing a more economical approach to deploying RF (Radio Frequency) devices closer to the end user PHYTunes believes it can help to unlock innovation and help the industry move forward at a more rapid pace. \n\n\nPHYTunes would like to thank the NSF for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant that allowed us to conduct this research. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Akula A Reddy"
