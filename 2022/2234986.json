 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a way to connect different webcam lighting studio networks together, and to test the network stability in diverse, real-life scenarios. Although the innovation was initially inspired by needs in the theatre industry, the technology may be applied to any webcam environment that could benefit from lighting design control, whether local or remote. Virtual theatre allows a company to expand its audiences beyond a geographic region and provides the ability to produce high-quality dramatic experiences at a fraction of the cost. The theatre industry may have the ability to reach a wider demographic, including the economically disadvantaged, the elderly, and people with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an Internet Protocol (IP)-enabled wireless interface for a set of smart lights that can be controlled by a central operator over the Internet. The technology is developed to provide customized options for live virtual theater, teleconferencing, online education, and other applications. The interfaces differs in pre-set lighting options as well as in the activities available to the operator. The prototype was developed for both video recording by a single-user video recording and for multi-user theaters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
