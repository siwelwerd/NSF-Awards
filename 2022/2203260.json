The meeting will focus on the plant cell wall, which makes up most of the plant biomass, interfaces with the external environment, and supports the growth of the entire organism. Understanding the cellular and extracellular processes necessary to build and maintain the plant cell wall is important because cell wall biosynthesis and remodeling during growth and disease are largely uncharacterized processes, and because of the relevance of the cell wall for food, fiber, fuel, and other materials that are indispensable to humans. A better understanding of how the cell wall is synthesized, deposited, and maintained during plant growth and in response to the environment can inform and improve biotechnological processes for increasing plant yield and resilience. Acquiring such knowledge requires the exchange of new ideas and results as well as the development and application of new technologies. \r\n\r\nThe IXCWRC aims to provide an open forum to discuss new ideas and theories, develop collaborations for scientists across the globe in a diverse and supportive environment, in addition to promoting and training the next generation of scientists through tailored workshops and activities. The NSF award will be used to develop an exciting program, particularly by broadening the participation of early career investigators to the meeting, facilitating their networking and fostering the foundations of an inclusive community in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because of the COVID19 pandemic, this meeting will be the first in-person plant cell wall meeting since 2019. There were 175 participants to the conference. The NSF award offset the registration costs for US-based early career investigators (EIs). This allowed the development of an exciting program, with 17 scientific sessions in which 66 speakers presented their results. 43 of the speakers were EIs. The award also partially offset the costs for a working lunch for EIs to provide them with an opportunity to interact in person in an informal setting. The meeting was successful in broadening the participation of EIs to the meeting, facilitating their networking and presentation of the latest research findings, and fostering the foundations of an inclusive community in science.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/09/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Federica&nbsp;Brandizzi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
