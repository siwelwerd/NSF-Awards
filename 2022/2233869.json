 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to provide travel support for 15 United States-based graduate students to attend the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning. This conference represents the first stand-alone conference that will expand on the theoretical and practical understandings of the vulnerabilities inherent to machine learning (ML) systems, explore the robustness of ML algorithms and systems, and aid in developing a unified scientific community aimed at creating trustworthy ML systems. The organizers will reserve at least 25% of this travel award for underrepresented groups, particularly women, minorities, and for first-time conference attendees. Participation in such conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support  will enable the participation of students who might otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE SaTML conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
