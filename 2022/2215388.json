 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based High Performance Computing Instrumentation (HPCI) at Cleveland State University (CSU) to facilitate and promote Smart City research. The research goal is to transform Cleveland to a modern smart city with shorter commute time even during rush hours, ultra-low crime rate, a highly robust and secure electric power grid, and successful professional sports teams contending for championships. The requested major research instrumentation will enable research in the following five areas: 1) Smart Traffic; 2) Smart Vehicle; 3) Smart Internet of Things (IoT); 4) Smart Microgrid; and 5) Smart Sports.  \r\n\r\nThe Smart Traffic project will develop novel deep learning methods to extract useful information from remote sensing traffic images under complex urban environments. The Smart Vehicle project will improve the state-of-the-art in reliable communications and in data processing among 5G-enabled Connected Vehicles and the Vehicle-to-Everything. The Smart IoT project will develop novel machine learning methods for wireless data-driven communication and wireless intelligent sensing. The Smart Microgrid project will develop novel hybrid learning methods to ensure system resiliency, cost effectiveness, efficiency, and security of microgrid. The Smart Sports project will develop new computer vision methods to recognize and evaluate fine-grained player activities towards more efficient training and player evaluation. The research has the potential to transform Cleveland into an exemplary smart city, and the research outcome could be applicable to many other urban areas in the US. The requested HPCI will make a substantial improvement to the CSU high performance computing capabilities, which will positively attract potential collaborative research in the Cleveland Metropolitan Area and greatly improve the quality of research training at CSU. The requested HPCI will support the undergraduate/graduate student research, education and training in several computer science/engineering and civil engineering courses at CSU. The research supports the K-12 education of Cleveland Metropolitan Area and also supports the Hispanic-minority research and education. The website for the project is at https://engineering.csuohio.edu/mri-hpc/  The project website is maintained by the Computer Systems Specialist of the Washkewicz College of Engineering at Cleveland State University. The research outcome, user guidance, news, and project related information will be provided and updated in this website over the expected lifetime of the requested instrument.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
