 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic and other natural disasters have negatively impacted the educational journeys of many students.  In particular, undergraduate students have had limited opportunities to experience research during their studies. This project aims to counteract this loss by providing recent graduates with the opportunity to gain meaningful experiences in research and receive professional development within the supportive environment of the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. The Research and Mentoring for Postbaccalaureates in Biological Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico (RaMP-UP) program will be the first postbaccalaureate program in Puerto Rico and will welcome the participation of individuals from groups that have been historically excluded from the research enterprise. RaMP-UP will have a huge impact on the life of trainees and contribute to diversifying the national scientific workforce. Moreover, many of the program\u2019s activities will be open to other students and faculty, thus expanding the impact of research training to a population beyond the program itself.  \r\n \r\nThe aims of RaMP-UP will be achieved by: (1) Attracting recent graduates in the biological sciences and related scientific disciplines to perform interdisciplinary biological research, (2) Providing students with a \u201chands-on\u201d in depth research experience, and  (3) Presenting a series of activities aimed at developing participants\u2019 research skills, including learning about the use of bioinformatic and computational approaches to Biology,  and professional tools needed to succeed in future science careers. Starting in the summer of 2023, 10 recent graduates will be recruited annually to work for one year on a research project under the guidance of one of the program mentors and co-mentors. A group of active researchers in the College of Natural Sciences will support participants throughout the research experiences and provide intensive mentoring. Faculty contacts in primary teaching universities will promote the program and serve as liaison between the program and prospective candidates.   It is expected that by the end of their internship, participants will have developed a deep understanding of biological research and have sufficiently advanced their projects to present their work in scientific meetings and potentially publish their findings in a peer-reviewed journal. The program also includes participation of a network of top institutions that are interested in recruiting promising students to their graduate programs.  Therefore, upon completion of the program, participants should have acquired the necessary knowledge, mentoring and skills to successfully continue their education toward advanced degrees in scientific fields, or other research-related scientific career pathways.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
