 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the Gordon Research Conference, \u201c2022 Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere Bridging Ecology, Chemistry and Climate.\u201d The conference will bring together scientists interested in biogenic hydrocarbons in the atmosphere that play an important role in plant ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry across a variety of scales. The meeting will focus on integrating the biological, ecological, and atmospheric roles of these compounds in a unique, cross-disciplinary environment.\r\n\r\nThis will be the 10th Gordon Research Conference to address the topic of \u201cBiogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere,\u201d the first of which was in 2000. Gordon Research Conferences are dedicated to presentations and discussions of cutting-edge research and provide an outstanding opportunity for early career researchers to interact with senior and world-class scientists in diverse fields. The intellectual merit of this conference includes the growth of a greater understanding of the synthesis, emissions and chemical processing of biogenic hydrocarbons in the atmosphere that will lead to the development of novel reliable methods of detection and quantification of volatiles in the atmosphere, their physiological and ecological roles, their influences in the Earth System and their fate in the atmosphere under current and future environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Gordon Research Seminar, to be held two days prior to the Conference, will bring together a cohort of the most promising early career researchers from a range of disciplines for a program of talks and discussions designed to facilitate networking and career development. The Conference will take place in Ventura, CA from June 12th to 17th, 2022 preceded by the Seminar on June 11-12.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
