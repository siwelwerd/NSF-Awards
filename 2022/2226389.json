 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of grid-scale energy storage. As electric grids begin to rely on intermittent solar and wind resources for clean energy generation, energy storage capacity must be integrated concurrently.  Studies have demonstrated the need for long-duration (8+ hour) energy storage beyond the capabilities of current lithium-ion battery technologies. The proposed  solution is a sustainable and affordable flow battery technology that wmay ultimately facilitate economical and reliable renewable energy integration for all communities (e.g., urban cities, off-grid areas, low-income housing, and large corporations/industries), ensuring environmental justice and energy equity.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of flow batteries storing energy in liquid phase chemicals to permit scalable and long-duration energy storage. This flow battery technology utilizes molecularly engineered organic molecules dissolved in pH neutral water. There is minimal fire risk during operation and low corrosivity if spillage occurs. The technology uses sustainable active materials that can be produced domestically at low-cost. The technology seeks to provide improved economics with round-trip energy efficiency and enhanced volumetric energy density to limit the  footprint of the battery. This technology may allow for long-term reliability for a highly variable intermittent renewable resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
