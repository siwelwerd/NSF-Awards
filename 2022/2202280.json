 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technologies are being developed at a much greater pace than ever using the quantum properties of materials. These peculiar behaviors, which for many decades were just an intellectual curiosity, are now set to transform the technologies we use in our daily lives. At the forefront of this is the development of light sources that can produce individual photons \u201con demand\u201d, known as single-photon emitters (SPE). Rare-earth elements, such as cerium and erbium, embedded into two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), could enable a quantum optical platform that matches the requirements for direct insertion into traditional optical communication infrastructure. Therefore, the principal investigators will evaluate the impact of incorporating rare-earth elements into 2D semiconductors and explore how to tune their properties for controllable light generation. Beyond the scientific impact, this collaborative project will provide interdisciplinary research training for female and underrepresented minority graduate students, which directly impacts the need to broaden participation in STEM programs. Finally, this program will enable them to participate in a range of outreach activities that connect their research and training to the educational mission of the Universities.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description. Quantum communication technologies are advancing at a continually increasing pace and are now set to transform the technologies we use in our daily lives. A key building block for this advancement is the single-photon emitter (SPE). Solid-state SPEs based on point defects, especially those with energies that match telecommunication requirements (i.e., near infrared (NIR): 1320-1550 nm), could dramatically change how we connect to one another in the future. The utilization of lanthanide (Ln) (rare-earth) elements as SPEs could enable a quantum optical platform that matches the requirements for direct insertion into traditional optical communication infrastructure. The principal investigators will employ a closely coupled combination of experimental methods to understand light emission from Ln-doped 2D semiconductor structures. They will evaluate the impact of 2D/substrate interface properties, element choice, and compound transformation processes on the 2D photonic and electronic properties through a series of interlocking objectives that include controlled doping of Ln elements in semiconducting 2D materials and correlating this with atomic-scale structural defects, semiconductor band structure, optical emission, and charge transport properties. Ultimately, the project aims to demonstrate electrically driven SPE devices based on Ln-doped 2D layer p/n homojunctions and benchmark optoelectronic performance. The success of this work will establish an understanding of the physical phenomena that enables controlled optical emission in 2D layers in the NIR, laying the groundwork for engineered 2D photonic crystals that are compatible with current semiconductor fabrication and optical communication technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
