 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project will improve knowledge about the sources and atmospheric impacts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from western U.S. wildfires. Biomass burning is estimated to be the second-largest primary sources of VOCs globally. VOCs play a key role in the atmosphere as precursors of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and affect hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, that in turn control the lifetime of most air pollutants. This project will combine data from laboratory experiments, and previous and new field measurements from aircraft and ground stations, with a 3D chemical transport model to examine the regional and global impacts of VOCs from wildfires.\r\n\r\nThis research includes tasks that: (1) carry out laboratory experiments to improve the analytical approach for identifying and quantifying atmospheric furans using Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry; (2) perform new ground measurements for VOCs and other trace gases at a long-term monitoring site in Missoula, MT, to better quantify critical controls on the abundance and variability of fire-related VOCs in the western U.S.; (3) incorporate new chemistry and emissions for furans and two other VOCs in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM); and (4) use the GEOS-Chem with improved fire VOC representation to interpret the previous and new in-situ measurements from recent aircraft and ground campaigns. The project will provide quantitative new constraints on VOCs' sources and chemical impacts from wildfires on a regional to global scale.\r\n\r\nThe education and outreach plan includes the development of a wildfire smoke exhibit with a mini air quality monitoring station at a hands-on science center to enhance K-12 student learning about wildfire smoke and air pollution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
