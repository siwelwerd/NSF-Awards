 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is undertaking a study to identify needs and opportunities to advance the mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations of digital twins in applications across science, medicine, engineering, and society. A digital twin is a computer model that changes over time to represent the structure or behavior of a unique physical entity, such as a manufacturing process, piece of equipment, or even a person. Based on data inputs, the digital twin can be used to gain insight into present and future states of the physical twin. The exploration and use of digital twins is growing across domains, but many state-of-the-art digital twins are largely the result of custom implementations that require considerable deployment resources and a high level of expertise. Due to the individualized nature of many digital twin implementations, the relative maturity of digital twins varies significantly across problem spaces. Moving from one-off digital twins to digital twin implementations at scale will involve addressing foundational mathematical, statistical, and computational gaps. This study aims to highlight these critical research gaps and provide options to address them with the goal of advancing the use of digital twins across disciplinary communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, will highlight needs and opportunities to advance the mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations of digital twins in applications across science, medicine, engineering, and society. A digital twin assimilates observational data and uses this information to continually update its internal models so that they reflect the evolving physical system. The digital twin is therefore continuously improving and provides a dynamic digital history of the physical entity. These core functionalities can be augmented with feedback control and artificial intelligence, combined with ensembles of similar twins, or used in tandem with other predictive tools to analyze and diagnose operational states and to optimize performance under real-world conditions. Utilization of digital twins varies across disciplines. This study will address the following: (1) diverging definitions of digital twins and domain-inspired use cases; (2) foundational mathematical, statistical, and computational gaps for the continued development of digital twins; (3) best practices for digital twin development and use; and (4) opportunities to move the community and state of practice forward.  Three domain-specific workshops will be held to explore the methods, practices, use cases, and challenges for the development and use of digital twins\u2014focus areas include biomedical domains, Earth and environmental systems, and aerospace engineering. Four reports will be released by the National Academies during the course of this 18-month study: three short summaries of the domain-specific workshops and a consensus report focused on the cross-cutting foundational research gaps and future directions for digital twins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\r\n\n\nThis study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine was launched to explore the foundational research gaps and opportunities for digital twins. As part of the information gathering process, the committee organized three targeted workshops (in engineering, climate sciences, and biomedical sciences)to better understand domain-specific nuances and barriers to developing digital twins. These sessions enabled cross-sector experts to surface field-specific needs, challenges, and open questions related to digital twins. Thousands of participants across multiple domains engaged in the discussions, which workshops were summarized in three separate Proceedings-in-Brief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe project culminated in a high-impact consensus study report that, despite its release late in the calendar year, became one of the top 10 most downloaded reports from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) in 2023. A central contribution of the was a unified definition for the term digital twins to guide scientific understanding and application. It also highlighted key case studies and laid out research needs for the mathematics, statistics, and computer science communities. Additionally, it addressed different application needs and requirements. The report also emphasized the need for enhanced verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification methods. Throughout the report, a wide array of gaps -- both focused research needs and systemic barriers -- were articulated. This study and all other publications associated with this project can be downloaded on the project webpage: https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/foundational-research-gaps-and-future-directions-for-digital-twins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFollowing the release of the report, committee members disseminated the report over the next year and a half at over 20 different conferences, agencies, and organizations. These efforts reached students, researchers, engineers, policymakers, and important stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nIn response to emerging questions not fully addressed in the report, the National Academies hosted a series of exploratory webinars. These webinars discussed Ethical Needs and Questions for Digital Twins, Regulatory Challenges and Approaches for Deploying Digital Twins, Human-Digital Twin Interactions, and Digital Twins for Social and Behavioral Systems. These webinars served to highlight for the public and research communities some of the logistical challenges and open questions that remain in digital twin implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nA particularly impactful outcome of this work was the identification and elevation of a diverse group of advocates for informed and responsible use of digital twins. Several committee members have since worked on translational and domain-specific efforts, shaping early adoption practices and setting the tone for broader public and professional discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWithin less than a year since the reports release and in response to the reports first recommendation, an interagency working group was formed to explore cross-cutting research and development challenges for digital twins. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program launched a Fast-Track Action Committee on Digital Twins in April 2024 to coordinate federal research and development to advance technology and accelerate the use of digital twin models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTogether, these efforts resulted in foundational literature and guidance surrounding the early landscape of digital twin research, practice, and policy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichelleKristinSchwalbe\n"
