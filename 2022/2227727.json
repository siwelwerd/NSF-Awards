 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of objective technology that could be utilized to potentially detect different responses to visual stimuli to model the functions of the optic nerve. This technology may allow physicians to triage patients who present with headaches or vision losses without the potential need for expensive and often additional tests only available at advanced ophthalmic clinics. This technology could also be used to monitor and predict the progression of a patient\u2019s disease, as it may reduce the intervals with which patients are currently seen by eye specialists.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the potential development of a vision screening test to evaluate relative afferent pupillary defects in a head-mounted display that may be affordable, convenient to use, and capable of generating an assessment of the health of the optic nerve. The core technology in the product is a tool that may allow physicians to be more involved with the care of their patients by performing routine eye exams remotely and at shorter time intervals. Non-specialists (principal care doctors or emergency doctors) may be among the primary customers of this product. Doctors could be able to make quick, reliable, and highly accurate measurements of afferent responses to visual stimuli to monitor the health of the optic nerve and its function, especially when their patient presents sudden and unexplainable vision changes or headaches. In addition, the product may be able to perform baseline tests to predict the patient\u2019s responses to treatment or the progression potential of their disease which could help reduce the number of clinic visits and increase doctors\u2019 productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
