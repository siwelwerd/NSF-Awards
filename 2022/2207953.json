 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for U.S. participation in the international conference \u201cTopological Quantum Electrons Interacting In-person\u201d to be held July 10 - 16, 2022, at the International Centre for Interdisciplinary Science Education (ICISE) in the city of Quy Nhon, Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together a diverse international group of theorists and experimentalists working in the field of electronic properties of quantum materials. Quantum materials refers to a class of materials for which their principal interesting properties result from unusual states of electronic matter that require quantum mechanical description. They are a consequence of the correlated motion of many electrons acting collectively. Often the relevant electrons are confined to two-dimensions. This conference will highlight recent developments in the study of the properties of novel quantum materials, including topological states of matter, twisted bilayer systems, magnetic materials, transition metal dichalcogenides, superconductors, and quantum phenomena in mesoscopic systems. Technological aspects of these subjects will be covered as well.\r\n\r\nMotivated by the long period in which in person interactions were disallowed due to the pandemic, the program of the conference will be prepared with in-person participation and an emphasis on highlighting junior participants and their scientific achievements.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will commence with a short series of pedagogical lectures by experts in theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum materials. The pedagogical lectures will be aimed at junior researchers to provide them with the necessary background to appreciate the research-level talks to come by leading researchers from across the world. The conference is organized to allow for informal interactions among junior and senior researchers, and cultural exchanges with the participants who will be representative of the global research community, particularly between US-based and Asian-based researchers who may not otherwise have the opportunity for extended interaction or even meet. US based researchers will have the opportunity to present their research and interact with a pool of world leading experts in the field that is difficult to assemble in the US. The NSF supported participants will be selected from a nationwide pool with selection determine by the organizing committee of the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
