 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton are microscopic single-celled plants that grow at the sun-lit surface of the ocean. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, phytoplankton live in sub-optimal conditions because the amount of iron in seawater is insufficient for growth. Moreover, the chemical composition of Southern Ocean phytoplankton is distinct from that in other ocean regions, with a higher proportion of phosphorus relative to other elements, a characteristic that ultimately influences the distribution of nutrients ocean-wide. The researchers hypothesize that the high phosphorus composition of phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean is caused by their low iron content. Specifically, they postulate that a phosphorus-rich molecule, phytic acid, is synthesized by phytoplankton in order to assist in the storage of iron in designated cellular compartments, such as vacuoles. Recent observations show that some phytoplankton can absorb phytic acid, suggesting that it may be produced by certain species. Phytic acid is pervasive in soils, wherein it aids absorption of iron via plant roots and could similarly help phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean acquire iron via the cell membranes. This project benefits the National Science Foundation's goals of improving understanding of interactions between the Southern Ocean and the global ocean, of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic biota and associated processes by focusing on phytoplankton species unique to the Antarctic. As part of this project, the Department of Marine Sciences from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Connecticut will sponsor the recruitment, relocation and mentorship of a graduate student under-represented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to determine whether the unusual elemental composition of phytoplankton at the Southern Ocean is a result of anemia. The work will query whether inositol hexakisphosphate (phytic acid) aids Antarctic phytoplankton acquire and store iron, resulting in an elevated fraction of cellular phosphorus relative to other elements. The researchers, including a graduate student, will conduct laboratory culture experiments with phytoplankton strains isolated from the Southern Ocean. They will grow cells in iron- deficient versus iron-replete media to see if their phosphorus content is higher in iron-deficient conditions. They will test whether cells grown with sufficient phosphorus acquire more iron, allowing them to grow better in iron-deficient conditions than cells deriving from phosphorus-poor conditions. They will also query whether cells grown in iron-deficient conditions achieve faster growth rates in the presence of phytic acid. Results will inform the design of CRISPR mutants with which to investigate phosphorus and iron co-metabolism in Antarctic marine phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
