 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Northwest Indian College.  Northwest Indian College is a tribal college located on Lummi Nation north of Seattle, Washington with six extended campuses throughout Washington State (Swinomish, Tulalip, Port Gamble, Muckleshoot, Nisqually) and one campus in Idaho (Nez Perce).  Over its 5 years duration, this project will fund scholarships to 43 unique full-time students who are pursing bachelor\u2019s degrees in Native Environmental Science.  Students starting in their first or second year will receive four- or three-year scholarships, respectively.    Northwest Indian College\u2019s mission is, \u201cthrough education, Northwest Indian College provides Indigenous self-determination and knowledge\u201d.  The Native Environmental Science program provides place-based, experiential, and culturally grounded curriculum and provides training in a diverse range of STEM careers. S-STEM scholars will participate in a multi-generational STEM community. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  Key components of that goal are:  remove financial barriers for academically talented, Indigenous science students; enhance student support services to increase year-to-year retention; build Indigenous science communities through S-STEM cohorts, alumni, and professional networks; articulate meaningful pathways to community-oriented post-graduation STEM employment; and reclaim Indigenous identity. Unique components of this work are the strengthening of Indigenous STEM cohorts through networking events and alumni-student mentoring to support community growth and reclaim Indigenous identity in STEM.  This project will generate new knowledge about how to successfully recruit, retain, and transition American Indian / Alaska Native students in STEM fields with positive job growth.  It will also provide scholarship on innovative and cutting-edge research projects that actively incorporate multiple ways of knowing and place-based approaches into its design.  The merit includes increasing the diversity of STEM fields by removing barriers for entry and promoting success. Innovative evaluation methodology based on the Indigenous Evaluation Framework will also contribute to an understanding of how to assess Indigenous Education. Results of this work will published through academic journals, educational platforms, and community presentations. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
