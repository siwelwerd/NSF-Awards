 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will document the use of DNA by law enforcement to study the complex landscape of DNA surveillance. The project will identify the actors, cultural logics, impacts, and mechanisms involved in DNA surveillance.  Findings from this project will provide insights and recommendations for policy makers interested in addressing the increased use of science and technology in the law. In addition, lawyers, criminal justice advocates, law enforcement, scientists, and citizens are all potential audiences for this research.\r\n\t\r\nThis project uses a mixed method design, including ethnographic observations, archival data analysis, in-depth interviews, and statistical analysis of DNA databases. Archival research and ethnographic observations at DNA forensic related webinars, conferences and trainings will help understand the overall expanded use of DNA forensics, including the key players, logics, and mechanisms involved. Archival and ethnographic data will be supplemented by interviews with key stakeholders on investments, motivations, justifications, tensions, and contradictions surrounding the expanded use of DNA. The project will also include a quantitative analysis of publicly available DNA database information to understand the impact of law enforcement\u2019s expanded DNA use and how the consequences are distributed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
