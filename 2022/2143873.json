 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficiently moving around and interacting with objects in novel environments requires building expectations about people (e.g., which side will an oncoming person pass by), places (e.g., where are car keys likely to be in a home), and things (e.g., which way will a door open). However, manually building such expectations into decision-making systems is challenging. At the same time, machine learning has been shown to be successful in extracting representative patterns from training datasets in many related application domains. While the use of machine learning to learn predictive models for decision-making seems promising; the design choices (data sources, forms of supervision, architectures for the predictive models, and interaction of the predictive models with decision-making) are deeply intertwined. As part of this project, investigators will identify the precise aspects in which machine learning benefits navigation and object interaction; and co-design datasets, models, and learning algorithms to build systems that realize these benefits. The project will improve the state-of-the-art of predictive reasoning for navigation and object interaction by designing approaches that can leverage large-scale diverse data sources for training. Models, datasets, and systems developed in this project will advance navigation and mobile manipulation capabilities. These will enable practical downstream applications (e.g., assistive robots, telepresence), and open up avenues for follow-up research (e.g., human-robot interaction). The project will contribute to the education of students and the broader community through curriculum development, engagement in research projects, and accessible dissemination of research.\r\n\r\nThe project will co-design data collection methods, learning techniques, and policy architectures to enable large-scale learning of predictive models for people, places, and things for problems involving navigation and mobile manipulation. Investigators will tackle the following three research tasks: (1) designing predictive models for people, places, and objects that are necessary for decision making; (2) identifying data sources and generating supervision to learn these predictive models at-scale; and (3) hierarchical and modular policy architectures that effectively use the learned predictive models. Investigators will re-use existing sense-plan-control components (motion planners, feedback controllers) where applicable (e.g., motion in free space), and introduce learning in modules that require speculation (i.e., high-level decision-making modules, e.g., identifying promising directions for exploration, predicting where will an oncoming human go next, what is a good position to open a drawer from). Investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of proposed methods by comparing the efficiency of systems with and without predictive reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
