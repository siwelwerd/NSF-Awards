 "awd_abstract_narration": "The significant gap between cutting-edge piezoelectric and hetero-integrated fabrication facilities and university-owned infrastructures in the United States limits experimental scientific research at the system level and educational capabilities for future workforce development nationwide. The proposed Nano Systems Innovation (NanoSI) Mid-scale RI-EW workshop will conduct a deep dive into infrastructure requirements to enable a unique national infrastructure for piezoelectric and hetero-integrated nanosystems. The workshop will concentrate on planning for infrastructure that can better align local research and prototyping capabilities of the universities with advanced semiconductor manufacturing activities. This meeting will enable the solicitation of community-rendered inputs to develop a unique national infrastructure and the required capabilities to address current and future needs. The proposed workshop will enable nationwide community engagement and broad discussion on the required infrastructure to address the aligned needs of all stakeholders in academia, government, and industry. In addition to faculty, industry and government laboratory attendees, the workshop team will intentionally target students and postdocs for attendance. The conference will specifically include invited talks and panels to discuss educational needs of the proposed infrastructure, such as new courses to address required skills in the future of manufacturing of integrated nanosystems and advanced semiconductors. The conference will have an invited talk on lessons learned from early-stage outreach in nanotechnology to explore effective pathways for extension of outreach programs to high school students. The conference, in addition to dedicated student/postdoc engagement personnel, will ensure the engagement and participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering (e.g., underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities). The program will include a Women in Engineering (WIE) breakout session anticipated to provide insights toward development of a diverse future workforce.\r\n\r\nConsidering high-impact scientific research needs for state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and the limits of standard research grants to address such needs, Northeastern University will organize a community-wide NanoSI workshop to explore a pathway to close the gap through a unique infrastructure. The workshop will focus on identifying the emerging needs for adaptable infrastructure that can address national research priorities in advanced hetero integration to post-COMS and more than Moore devices. The NanoSI virtual workshop will gather a diverse, multidisciplinary group of experts and leaders across academia, industry, and government to develop a broad vision to support advanced piezoelectric and hetero-integrated nanosystems manufacturing. The gathered thought leaders and field expert speakers will present ideas on all aspects of infrastructure development that will enable the community to address current and future national needs. The discussion panels will focus on thoroughly defining the priorities for all aspects of the infrastructure. The outputs of this broad community engagement on the proposed NanoSI infrastructure will allow the Northeastern team to build a concrete plan with comprehensive community support for future submissions to NSF.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the Nano Systems Innovation (NanoSI) workshop was to solicit feedback from researchers regarding requirements to enable a unique national infrastructure for piezoelectric and hetero-integrated nano systems. The project objectives were to learn from experts in the field about their needs for a heterogeneous integration facility that would serve users nationwide, convene users and stakeholders from industry, academia, and national labs to discuss potential facility capabilities, and develop the ideas into a pre-proposal for a mid-scale II proposal. \n\n\nThe virtual workshop, held on November 4, 2022, brought together researchers, US government, industry and foundry partners to identify the emerging needs for adaptable infrastructure that can address national research priorities in advanced hetero integration to post-CMOS and more than Moore devices. \n\n\nBefore the workshop, the PIs solicited pre-recorded, invited talks from 65 nano- and micro-scale researchers with national and international reputations at 45 institutions.  Presenters from 12 states representing academia (19 talks from 13 institutions), government labs (3 talks), and industry (5 talks, 2 with joint academic appointments, from 4 companies) presented a total of 27 recorded talks. These talks described their work and outline what resources would be necessary for the vision of heterogeneous systems integration. They also highlighted technological areas of interest and provided multiple perspectives on the value proposition of a national infrastructure for piezoelectric and hetero-integrated nano systems. \n\n\nIn the pre-meeting videos, we heard participants raise topics about financial sustainability, where it would be located (distributed or localized), how users would engage with such a facility, how to get participation from stakeholders in government research and industry as well as academia, and the importance of certain tools such as 8-inch fabrication. These points were presented to attendees in the workshop. \n\n\nA major point of discussion across more than one breakout room was the impact of such a facility, and its potential to help grow the US market. Several attendees highlighted that the focus only on piezoelectric material integration might limit the utility of NanoSI in these goals, but that focus on some well-scoped subset of materials would be necessary. \n\n\nAdvantages of the NanoSI vision included mitigating intellectual property concerns that are currently embedded in sending designs to international fabrication facilities and the benefit of domestic access to 8-inch wafer tools at small scale. Common themes were the challenges of low volumes present in academic research, scaling from a handful to 100s of devices, and the tensions in a facility built for research and prototyping in contrast to one intended for production. The need for infrastructure that would attract small and large industrial partners was stated in all three breakout sessions. \n\n\nAttendees also highlighted a few logistical challenges embedded in running such a facility: the need for a revenue model that would support long-term staffing, the requirement to be \"forward-thinking\" so that tools and facilities would not soon become obsolete, and how remote participation could be supported given local facilities with a nationwide user base. Broadly, participants encouraged each other and the PIs to consider the role and impact of NanoSI on US nanofabrication over the next 20-30 years, rather than 5-10 years. \n\n\nThis discussion led to a realignment of the vision for a heterogeneous \"+X\" facility that bridges the gap between research and prototyping facilities and commercialization fabs. Such a facility would foster translation of research out of academia, support start-up companies, and increase the technology readiness level of devices in development. \n\n\nThe National Infrastructure for NanoSystem Innovation and Heterogeneous Integration (INNOVATE) facility, a unique national research and development facility, will combine emerging technologies in device manufacturing and heterointegration with advanced semiconductor devices for future computational, communications and sensing hardware. The facility will accommodate diverse substrate sizes from smaller chips to 200mm wafers. This facility will help develop next-generation core technologies by providing research infrastructure for monolithic integration, wafer bonding, chip-level bonding (fanout wafers), advanced transfer and additive processes, and 2D and quantum materials manufacturing and beyond, in the US. It will also provide much-needed training of a workforce for future semiconductor and quantum fabrication/manufacturing facilities. The Northeastern University's (NU\u2019s) global university system, with 13 campuses spanning the US, Canada, and the UK, and which includes EPSCoR Jurisdictions, ensures vibrant engagement across the US. \n\n\nINNOVATE\u2019s vision responds to the needs identified in the NanoSI workshop and in the 2021 NSF Workshop on CMOS+X Technologies. Domestic semiconductor device manufacturing and heterointegration facilities were identified as an urgent need for bridging the current gap in exploratory and fundamental research and retaining US innovation leadership. With the rapid emergence of beyond-silicon, beyond CMOS, and quantum engineering genres, a facility that supports multiple technologies and material systems and their integration &ndash; and which is readily and affordably accessible to university researchers and trainees &ndash; is a critical need for addressing future computational, communication, sensing and workforce demands. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matteo Rinaldi"
