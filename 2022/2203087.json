The conference will feature established and emerging leaders in all aspects of plant RNA biology. This is the continuation of two long-running conference series, and is expected to draw an international group of attendees. The conference will include two keynote addresses, 19 invited lectures, and 15 contributed presentations, as well as two poster sessions. Travel awards and outreach will ensure a diverse group of participants. Students will have prominent roles at the conference, helping to organize and run the sessions, as well as presenting their own research. A publication describing findings from the symposium will be led by graduate student attendees, providing valuable professional experience and tangible outcomes for their career advancement. \r\n\r\nRNA biology is a fast-moving field that is impacting all areas of the life sciences. Plants are at the forefront of RNA biology, both as tractable model systems and in the context of enhancing agricultural productivity. Pivotal discoveries in RNA structure, gene regulation, and epigenetics are coming from plant systems. The conference will cover exciting advances in the areas of small regulatory RNAs, RNA structure, RNA processing, RNA localization, translational control of gene expression, and epigenetics and chromatin modifications. This symposium will gather leading investigators, early stage scientists, trainees, and students in an intimate setting. This will allow for information sharing on the cutting edge of this field. The comprehensive plan for recruiting participants will ensure that the gathering will catalyze collaborations that may not otherwise happen.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems of the Biological Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
