 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-cantilever-based tools like variable Atomic Force Microscopies have been widely and successfully used in the field of Nano Science and Technology for decades. Based on vast available experimental results and expertise in multiple domains, there is a significant potential to use cantilever-based systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses binding by responding to the added mass. This approach will enable real time monitoring and handling the COVID-19 pandemic and will enable the observation of the infection and the transmission of the host for first time. However, the exploitation of cantilever devices for pathogen detection faces multiple hurdles, in addition to technical challenges, as high selectivity to the targeted virus or biomarker is required. To become practical these instruments need a technology for functionalization of the cantilevers that will make them stable in air and liquids for hours. This will allow the sensors to work in real time, thus breaking the current pathogen diagnostics paradigm. \r\n\r\nIn this project the PIs will develop such functionalization of existing micro-cantilevers. They will develop a method for small pitch immobilization of antibodies selectively on the surface of the active cantilevers. The proposed project explores function-driven design of materials and technology to address the problem of real time detection of active viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The integrated approach developed in this project is versatile and transferable in developing proteins/antibody coatings for many other applications. Moreover, the proposed project, with its integration of material synthesis, UV exposure/patterning, characterization, and performance evaluation in the targeted applications, will serve as an excellent educational platform for participating graduate students to experience the full range of challenges in the cross-linking domains of microelectronics, biochemistry and health.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, these goals will be achieved through the combination of coating of fluorescent tagged antibody solutions in combination with maskless UV photoinduced patterning for immobilization that ensures selective binding of active viruses on cantilevers. The versatile approach of the PIs will include application of different benzophenone class of compound radicals generated by UV light and capable of reliably binding the targeted spike protein\u2019s antibody at the molecular level. Specific goals of this project are the identification and testing of UV maskless technology for selective immobilization of spike protein antibodies on piezoresistive MEMS cantilevers as well as optimizing the parameters of the detection system in order to achieve short detection time and high sensitivity. To achieve noise-free operation, application-specific arrays of active and reference piezoresistive cantilevers will be used. To ensure detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in air/aerosol by affinity reactions, small pitch patterns will be selectively coated, exploiting maskless UV photoinduced protein immobilization of antibodies. Specifically, the PIs will focus on the selective functionalization of the optimized cantilevers in synergy with novel measuring methods for detecting the mass of ultra-small pathogens.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The pre-symptomatic period for COVID-19 varies between 3 and 7 days; meanwhile, infected people are able to transmit the infection to others. This gap in time between infection and symptoms is why methods based on detection of specific symptoms or biomarkers of patients are not effective to constrain the spread of pandemics. Similarly, efficiency of most of the widely applied anti-pandemic measures is low but just provide statistical data about events that already have happened.</p>\r\n<p>The key goal of the current project is to contribute toward outbreak prevention by monitoring, quantitively in real time, by revealing the events of infection transmission. To ensure this, active pathogens (infection agents) themselves must be detected instead of their fragments or resulted biomarkers in the infected persons. Since other virus detection methods rely on the latter two options [3], the new method is disruptive in respect to state-of-the-art in the field. The processing time needed to detect targeted active pathogens and the availability of equipment that fits point-of-care (POC) requirements are also decisive factors.&nbsp; Precise but slow methods and highly sophisticated lab equipment that requires stringent lab conditions and specifically trained personnel are not good options for mass screening the population in emergency circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>For more than 20 years MEMS cantilever-based approaches for detection of viruses and pathogens have been dismissed as a valuable option mainly because of two main reasons. The first one is using optical detection of cantilever resonance frequency as vast majority of AFM cantilevers do. This approach makes it practically impossible to work in differential mode, which turns out to be necessary due to inherent drift of biosensors caused by changing temperature, flow rate, concentration and pH of the analyzed media.</p>\r\n<p>Our approach is based on a new method for detection of a single pathogen with &ldquo;large-size&rdquo; thin cantilever array sensors, developed by Bulgarian SME of AMG Technology Ltd. Sensors shown in attached Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 images, comprise thick and rigid body and an array of consecutively ordered reference and active piezoresistive cantilevers, that specifically have incrementally shifted resonance frequencies. Active cantilevers are provided with additional thin metal film patterns for a selective functionalization, optionally connected to a contact pad to apply a voltage. Two symmetrically embedded piezoresistors are located on each of both: active and reference cantilevers. Both piezoresistors on a cantilever, are connected in different voltage dividers, optionally exploiting permanent resistors located on the rigid body. Voltage dividers comprising piezoresistors located on consecutive cantilevers, are further connected in full Wheatstone bridges.</p>\r\n<p>The main advantages of piezoresistive MEMS for detection of viruses in air and human breath are listed as follows:</p>\r\n<p>1. No external components and alignment procedures are required to run an ultrasensitive measurement, including sensor replacement.</p>\r\n<p>2. By exploiting reference and active cantilevers, the detection of signals below background noise level can be achieved.</p>\r\n<p>3. By mixing signals from different voltage dividers on consecutive cantilevers in a suitable manner, on-chip signal compensation or amplification of the resulting analog output signal can be achieved.</p>\r\n<p>4. Novel detection methods based on compensation, including by tuning the specific signals phases- Fig. 3, are feasible for further research and validation in a lab and POC environment.</p>\r\n<p>5. Due to an embedded thin metal film heater, specific modes of oscillation, local temperature and electrical potential per selected cantilevers can be used to improve targeted parameters like Q-factor, sensitivity optimization, etc.</p>\r\n<p>6. Low power hand-held autonomous systems shown in Fig. 4 are feasible.</p>\r\n<p>7. Detection in human breath will not require any sample preparations</p>\r\n<p>By relying on these fundamental advantages, we developed the first prototype of point of care (POC) diagnostics for detection of one kind of virus, which includes measurement devices, custom developed software and specially designed MEMS cantilevers with and without Au coating for next steps of proteins and antibody immobilization. We succeeded in showing the viability of the system by detection of nonspecific (physical) and specific (covalent) adsorption of thiol modified bovine serum albumin (BSA-SH). The smallest detected specific (covalent) adsorption of BSA-SH was 1.353 nano grams. In addition, we started to develop specific bioconjugation strategies for immobilization of real COVID antibodies.
