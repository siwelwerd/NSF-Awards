 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to produce new products for filler materials and in construction materials. The proposed technology enables industries emitting CO2 and producing alkaline industrial residues to capture and convert their emissions into commercially useful and stable products. It will replace the mining of carbonate materials with engineered products, meeting the growing demand for green construction materials.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will lead to the development of an innovative low-temperature approach to convert captured CO2 emissions into calcium and magnesium carbonates with regular particle size distributions. Currently there is no process in industry that integrates CO2 capture and regeneration via solid carbonate formation with regular pore size distributions. The proposed technology is an energy-efficient alternative to conventional thermally driven energy-intensive grinding approaches. The project will address challenges associated with the low solubility of CO2 by harnessing regenerable solvents, such as sodium glycinate. As an alternative to thermal regeneration of solvents, the CO2-loaded solvents are chemically regenerated using calcium and magnesium bearing materials that react with CO2 to produce inorganic carbonates and regenerate the solvents. The chemical regeneration of solvents at 50-75 \u00b0C via solid carbonate formation is significantly lower compared to conventional thermal regeneration of solvents which occurs above 90 \u00b0C. Calcium and magnesium carbonates with well-ordered particle size distributions are realized using turbulent vortices in a Taylor-Couette reactor customized for these studies. The research will advance fundamental aspects of reactor engineering, tuning of multiphase chemical interactions, and practical challenges of scalable implementation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
