 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support participation of early-career researchers in the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Chapman Conference titled, \u201cIntegrated Assessments: Solving Water Availability Challenges through an Interdisciplinary Framework.\u201d Early career scientists will: (1) get information via presentations and discussions about current challenges and leading research, (2) get introduced to experts or interested researchers seeking collaborations through participation in sessions and workshops, and (3) achieve a better understanding of how to broaden their research to incorporate integrated goals and objectives to contribute towards current interdisciplinary challenges. Discussions, outcomes, and working groups or relationships that result from this conference will directly impact the future of integrated water availability assessments and how water resource challenges are addressed throughout the U.S. and around the world. \r\n\r\nThe conference aims to explore divergent views, assumptions, data types, and research methods to facilitate integrated assessments of water availability and move the state of the science forward. This conference will provide an overview of current challenges, recent progress, and pathways toward the improvement of integrated assessments and interdisciplinary science to address water availability research. Despite the inherent complexity of water availability, the hydrologic cycle has historically been studied from narrow disciplinary perspectives and isolated from societal context. This conference is structured to facilitate discussion between researchers, practitioners, and disciplinary experts to propel interdisciplinary collaboration forward.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
