 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by using a two-stage exam process to identify students\u2019 knowledge gaps and improve student learning in computer science. Exams are dependable and convenient assessment tools for educators, however, they can cause student anxiety. Exams are often one-shot events resulting in no incentive for students to correct any learning deficiencies. Timely feedback on student exam answers can help students identify knowledge gaps. This project will develop and assess a two-stage exam process for an introductory computer programming course. Students will take a multiple choice exam in which they will provide a justification for each selected answer. For students who have significant knowledge gaps, an interview will follow, providing a second opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding. After the interview, a plan of action will be provided for each student to help them achieve the learning outcomes. It is expected that the project will help improve student learning outcomes in a foundational computer science course, which will help prepare students for professional practice in the computing workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: (1) improve student learning outcomes, (2) reduce test anxiety, and (3) support academic integrity. This project builds on previous work on two-stage exams in the physics education community. In the first stage, an improved multiple-choice assessment will be used to identify student knowledge gaps. The second stage consists of a one-on-one interview which will focus on questions related to the knowledge gaps identified in the first stage. Instructors will then develop a plan of study that will be personalized for each student. Research questions include: (1) What additional insights will the improved multiple-choice exam provide over a standard multiple-choice exam? 2) To what extent does the interview stage help to improve students\u2019 learning outcomes? To answer these questions, test results will be compared using traditional versus the improved multiple choice exam. Student learning gains will be assessed with and without the interview stage. The results of the proposed project will be disseminated at computer science education conferences and one computing education community site organized by Association for Computing Machinery education board. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
