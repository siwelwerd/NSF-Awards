 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to advancements in data acquisition techniques over the last two decades, new types of exceedingly complex datasets have emerged and present tremendous challenges that require synergy of interdisciplinary ideas for analysis and decision making. As a result, the field of data-science is rapidly evolving as an interdisciplinary field, where advances often result from combinations of ideas from multiple disciplines. A convening of leading experts, early-career researchers, and students from varied disciplines to exchange ideas is essential for progress in this field. Texas A&M University will host a two-day conference on Advances in Data Science in February 2022. More information on the conference can be found at  https://stat.tamu.edu/advances-in-data-science-conference/.\r\n \r\nThe primary objective of the conference is to provide a much-needed platform for accelerating the depth and quality of research on the foundations of data science through interdisciplinarity. The conference will bring together researchers from three major disciplinary areas (Statistics, Mathematics and Engineering) for presentation and dissemination of their research, to engage in discussions and foster future collaborations. This conference will involve women, minorities and young researchers across the nation. The conference will present a tremendous opportunity for first generation undergraduate students to be inspired and pursue careers in data-science in both academia and industry.  The conference will feature a number of activities to engage the students and recognize their contributions through awards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
