 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement an innovative program to provide a comprehensive student experience that includes research, career development, and mentoring. Every year a selected group of undergraduate minority students interested in STEM will be invited to participate in a workshop at the beginning of the INFORMS Annual Meeting. The workshop is complemented by individualized mentoring with leaders in the field by participating in structured sessions that will guide students on topics including career choices, networking strategies, and tools to make the most of their participation at the conference. This project will play an essential role in increasing the pipeline of underrepresented minority students in Operations Research and Management Sciences by exposing undergraduate students to the cutting-edge research presented at the meeting. From their attendance at the conference and mentoring sessions, students will learn the current state of the art in the field, and form professional connections. As stated by NSF's mission, this project grant contributes to the prosperity and welfare of the nation and contributes toward a more productive workforce development by investing in the next generation of researchers in Operations Research and Management Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project has three concrete goals: Organize a comprehensive training workshop that will provide participants with the tools to navigate the conference successfully, support student participation at the INFORMS Annual Meeting, and promote the adoption of student mentoring programs in the Operations Research and Management Science community. The project will implement a mentoring program to help students navigate several critical stages in their development as scientists. Moreover, the project will also develop guidance to foster similar mentoring programs in other operation research and management science venues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
