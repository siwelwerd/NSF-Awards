 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will advance scientific understanding of disease risk dynamics. Wildlife diseases are common in nature and occasionally \u201cspill over\u201d from wildlife to human populations. Despite this link to human well-being, scientists lack a comprehensive understanding of the environmental attributes associated with the emergence and spread of wildlife diseases. In particular, the relationship between biodiversity and disease risk (e.g., whether biodiversity amplifies or dilutes disease risk) is poorly understood, and it is unclear how this relationship might be altered with ongoing global change. Therefore, the project will apply state-of-the-art modeling approaches to understand the dynamic relationship between biodiversity and disease risk. By seeking generalities in biodiversity\u2013disease relationships and documenting their context dependence, the project will enhance future predictions of threats to human health posed by wildlife diseases. \r\n\r\nThe project will characterize spatiotemporal variation in biodiversity\u2013disease relationships using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) on rodent\u2013tick (Lyme disease) and bird\u2013mosquito (West Nile virus) systems. In particular, the fellow will investigate 1) whether biodiversity\u2013disease relationships from the two systems scale similarly over space, 2) the sensitivity of these relationships to biodiversity change, and 3) the influence of seasonality and climate on temporal dynamics of biodiversity\u2013disease relationships. The fellow will develop multiscale, integrated models, which allow multiple datasets (i.e., data on hosts as well as vectors) to be combined into a cohesive whole. The integrated model\u2014applied in a Bayesian framework\u2014will accomplish this linkage by estimating host biodiversity metrics in a host submodel and then using these quantities as predictors in a disease submodel. Integrated models are gaining prominence in biological disciplines due to their effectiveness in understanding complex phenomena, and this project will inform future investigations that combine datasets to tackle problems in disease ecology. In addition to the research, the fellow will undertake career training activities (e.g., statistical workshops) and engage in activities to broaden participation in science, including mentoring an undergraduate student in summer research and leading a training module on using NEON data in a graduate ecology course.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Lyme disease is a zoonotic disease which affects &gt;400,000 people annually in the United States; previous work has shown greater incidence of Lyme disease in areas with low host diversity. However, past work has quantified host diversity&rsquo;s effect only at local scales (e.g., within a plot) and has not considered host diversity in the landscape surrounding a focal plot. This project addressed this gap by using pathogen surveillance and small mammal monitoring data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, or NEON. Importantly, NEON has a hierarchical sampling scheme with replicated plots within several kilometers of each other within a site. The project developed models to estimate abundance of small mammals (which are important hosts for Lyme disease) at each plot from a NEON live-trapping dataset. These abundance estimates were then used to derive biodiversity metric variables such as species richness and Shannon diversity for each plot and aggregated across plots within a NEON site (i.e., landscape scale). The project then used a pathogen surveillance dataset from NEON which provides <em>Borrelia</em> (the bacterial taxon which causes Lyme disease in humans) infection presence for a subset of small mammals; infection presence was modeled as a function of each biodiversity metric, at the two scales (local and landscape). Relationships between <em>Borrelia</em> infection prevalence and host biodiversity did indeed vary when biodiversity was quantified at the different spatial scales, and these scaling behaviors were idiosyncratic among the five biodiversity metrics evaluated. For example, species richness of local communities showed a negative (dilution) effect on infection prevalence, while species richness at the landscape level showed a positive (amplification) effect on infection prevalence. In contrast, total abundance of the local community showed a negative (dilution) effect on infection prevalence, while total abundance at the landscape level showed no association with infection prevalence. These results indicate that a focus on individual spatial scales when assessing the influence of biodiversity on disease risk provides an incomplete picture of the complexity of disease dynamics in ecosystems. Moreover, the project developed methods for analyzing biodiversity data from NEON; the multispecies capture-recapture models developed offer a streamlined analytical option compared to existing methods, and analysis pipelines associated with the project were archived in an open-source repository. In addition to the research described above, the awardee worked on 6 other scientific papers during the fellowship, contributed to four broader-impacts activities (including research mentoring of students and organizing early career development and networking opportunities), and participated in training activities relating to research and mentoring.
