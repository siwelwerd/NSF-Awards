There were 484 registered participants.  The program consisted of five kinds of activities:\n\n \nKeynotes &ndash; the event had three keynote speakers: Cindy Cohn (Electronic Frontier Foundation), Yi-Kai Liu (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and Renee DiResta (Stanford Internet Observatory).
