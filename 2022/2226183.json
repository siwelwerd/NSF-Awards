 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prediction of organismal characteristics based on genetic signatures of an individual\r\norganism is a fundamental problem in biology. Recent advancements in the field indicate that \r\nmicrobiome, a community of microorganisms found in all environments on earth from human\r\nbodies to soils, plays an essential role in determining the function of ecosystems. Microbiome\r\ngenerates a variety of metabolites that serve as messengers for the microbiome to communicate\r\nwith its surroundings. It remains unclear how these messengers communicate. This research\r\nintends to decipher the molecular language of microbiome-environment interactions, thereby\r\nresolving a major enigma in life sciences. Understanding the fundamental rules governing\r\nmicrobiome-environment interactions will facilitate the solution of pressing problems in\r\nagriculture, environment, energy, and human health/well-being. By modulating the function of the\r\nmicrobiome in plants, for instance, agriculture could become more productive while requiring less\r\npesticides and fertilizers. Utilizing the microbiome's photosynthetic energy is a promising\r\nalternative clean energy solution. Maintaining gut microbiome stability may improve human\r\nimmunity. This multidisciplinary research involving biology, chemistry, and computer\r\nscience will create opportunities for underrepresented students in life sciences to pursue\r\ncareers in computer science and bioinformatics, fields in which racial and ethnic minorities are\r\nwoefully underrepresented.\r\n\r\nMetabolite-protein interactions (MPIs) play a major mechanistic role in maintaining microbiome\r\ncommunities and mediating microbiome-host interactions. Exploration of the global landscape of\r\nMPIs and the host gene expressions regulated by the MPI would fill critical knowledge gaps in\r\ncausal environment-genotype-phenotype associations. However, our understanding of MPIs and\r\ntheir regulatory pathways is limited due to the transient and low-affinity nature of MPIs. Existing\r\nexperimental techniques for determining MPIs and their functional roles are time-consuming,\r\nbiased to certain molecules, or applicable on a relatively small scale. The rapid growth of multiple\r\nomics data provides us with new opportunities to predict MPIs across entire microbiomes and host\r\ngenomes. However, due to noisiness, biasness, incompleteness, and heterogeneity of omics\r\ndata sets, their potential has not been fully appreciated for developing accurate, robust, and\r\ninterpretable predictive models for MPIs and their functions. The project will develop an\r\ninnovative AI-powered multi-scale modeling framework to predict biological functions of\r\nmicrobiome metabolites by integrating diverse data from chemical genomics, structural genomics,\r\nand functional genomics. Specifically, this research will develop a novel end-to-end meta-learning\r\nmethod following a sequence-structure-function paradigm to predict genome-wide microbiome\r\nmetabolite-host protein interactions, and innovative domain adaption methods to translate cell line\r\nscreens to host systemic responses to microbiome metabolites by disentangling intrinsic biological\r\nsignals from both biological and technical confounders. An immediate outcome will be a bespoke\r\nplatform to infer novel biological relationships from noisy, biased, and incomplete data, which\r\nwill have broad applications in addressing many fundamental biological problems. Another far-reaching\r\nbenefit will be the discovery of novel genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms of\r\nbiological processes. Completing this project will provide a powerful computational framework to\r\ncorrelate molecular interactions to physiological processes, and establish causal environment microbiome-genotype-phenotype associations.
