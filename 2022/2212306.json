 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award develops a novel biological cell-like system for accessing and processing information in molecular data systems. Specifically, the investigators will build new technologies that enable customized gene expression in an electronic system and perform information processing in molecular form. The goals of the project explore new methods of hybrid electronic-molecular engineering that leverage progress in molecular mechanisms, DNA sequencing technology, and electronics. In developing a novel approach to electrically-actuated gene expression, the project presents a path towards building integrated hybrid systems that draw on the strengths of electronics (size, precision, control) and molecular components (density, parallelism, efficiency), enabling new computing applications. Beyond computing, the project has the potential to enable new methods of characterizing and controlling synthetic genetic systems with impact in the life sciences, bioengineering, and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical objectives include 1) an electronically programmable cell-free gene expression system (\u201ceChromatin\u201d) that will automate dynamic sourcing of biological reagents needed to operate biochemical processes within molecular information systems; and 2) new methods of processing information stored in molecular form, such as DNA data random access and content-based similarity search using a new CRISPR-Cas9 addressing scheme and nanopore sequencing for fast and highly multiplexed access of molecular data.  The eChromatin system design consists of a switchable electrode array in a flow cell patterned with unique DNA components that can be electronically exposed or sequestered, enabling dynamic gene expression analogous to the remodeling of natural chromatin-DNA complexes. The Cas9-based data access strategy is designed to have significant advantages over previous work in DNA data storage, including 1) decreased time-to-decoding by eliminating PCR prep and cycle time, 2) increased multiplexability, 3) increased storage densities, and 4) increased energy efficiencies due to replacing PCR heating and cooling steps with isothermal reactions. The investigators will then integrate these approaches in a demonstration of automated end-to-end protocols within large-scale DNA data pools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
