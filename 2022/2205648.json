 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The nature of emerging technologies and how they fit together to create products and processes that drive economic growth makes it essential that engineers understand research developments, techniques and approaches beyond their own discipline. The FOE symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. The FOE symposia are also expected to increase the visibility of engineering and to highlight the key roles through which engineers serve society.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for three Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, to be held in 2022. These symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in concert with international partner organizations, are for early career researchers. The meetings to be funded by this award in 2022 are: China-America FOE (CAFOE; July, 2022; Chengdu, China); US FOE (September, 2022; Seattle, Washington); and EU-US FOE (October, 2022; Bled, Slovenia). The 2022 CAFOE will focus on: Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing; Food Safety in the Context of Big Data and Genomics; Water Sustainability; Wearable Electronics and Human Health. Topics for the 2022 US FOE symposium are: Advances in Infectious Disease Diagnostics and Treatment; The Hydrogen Economy; Technology and Racial Justice and Equity; Conversational AI. The EU-US meeting will cover: Post-Lithium Batteries; Prosthetics and AI; Supply Chain/Logistics; Sustainable Buildings. Approximately 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each 2.5 day symposium will include plenary sessions, break-out and poster sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. As the scheduled dates for each symposium approaches, pandemic status assessments will be conducted to determine whether to hold each meeting in-person or convert to virtual or hybrid formats. FOE symposium papers, abstracts, presentation videos, and slides will be made available on the FOE website (www.naefrontiers.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
