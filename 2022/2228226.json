 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing science and math faculty with practical skills to teach students with disabilities at two-year colleges. A greater proportion of the student population at two-year colleges have documented disabilities compared with four-year institutions. To improve inclusivity and diversity in STEM, it is important that students with disabilities achieve success at rates comparable to the whole population. While reasonable accommodations are provided for each student, more nuanced techniques will enhance the student experience, provide more opportunities for success, and give guidance to faculty. This training conference will bring expertise to science and math faculty at two-year colleges, engaging them in specific, practical, and immediately implementable skills to better engage with neurodivergent students, and students with visual, auditory, or mobility disabilities. Conference participants will learn techniques, initiate a community of practice to support each other, and become faculty liaisons within their own institutions and regional groups.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to convene a conference that prepares two-year college faculty to support students with disabilities. Participants in the conference will include two-year college faculty in math, physics, and chemistry. The conference will offer workshops to help faculty enhance student graphical literacy among students with visual disabilities, and to ensure laboratory safety for students with mobility disabilities. Participants will gain first-hand knowledge of accessibility challenges through a student-led science museum tour and a panel discussion. Disciplinary and cross disciplinary discussions will support the creation of communication channels to brainstorm specific strategies for inclusive teaching while providing opportunities for participants to develop and facilitate similar workshops in their home institutions. The conference will be organized by the leaders of three two-year college professional organizations and convened in Minneapolis, Minnesota with expected attendance of 24 participants. Dissemination will involve multiple modalities, including presentations at conferences, professional disciplinary societies and a handbook of helpful practices will be widely distributed. The NSF program description on Advancing Innovation and Impact in Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-year Institutions of Higher Education supports projects that advance STEM education initiatives at two-year colleges. The program description promotes innovative and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
