 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University (ASU) leads a multi-institution Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Efficient Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation Systems (EVSTS) that supports the U.S. automotive industry\u2019s effort to meet demanding federal regulations governing vehicle fuel economy and emissions, and society\u2019s expectations for improved sustainability. Achieving environmental sustainability is a generational problem that represents one of the most critical technological challenges of our time. Electricity generation (31%) and transportation (27%) are the largest contributors to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Wheeled ground vehicles, in turn, generate most of the transportation emissions and have an increasing impact on emissions from electricity generation. Solutions must address vehicle sustainability without unduly disrupting an industry that is central to the nation\u2019s economic health and its citizens\u2019 lifestyles. The EVSTS Center engages the automotive industry\u2019s critical stakeholders - vehicle manufacturers, component and system suppliers, fleet operators, ground transportation infrastructure providers, and state / local governments - in yielding transformational improvements in the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of ground vehicles. Scope of the work encompasses passenger cars, trucks, and motorized non-road equipment, as well as vehicle-level technologies and transportation system infrastructure, reflecting the complexity and global nature of the automotive and ground transportation industries.\r\n\r\nThe EVSTS center leverages collaborations among corporate, government, and academic partners to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant research on technologies and tools that facilitate the design, manufacture, deployment, and operation of energy efficient, environmentally sustainable vehicles. Research is conducted in five technical areas: 1) electrified vehicle powertrains, 2) conventional powertrains and alternative fuels, 3) non-powertrain vehicle systems optimization, 4) efficient / sustainable autonomous vehicles, and 5) transportation systems and infrastructure. Specifically, ASU\u2019s expertise in power electronic converters and systems, energy efficient microelectronics circuits, and system integration helps companies design and move toward commercializing sustainable electrified vehicles. Recent significant investments in Arizona\u2019s semiconductor and automotive industries strategically position ASU to collaborate with emerging EV manufacturers and charging station companies, to create education and training opportunities for a green manufacturing work force, and to engage semiconductor companies in research collaboration by bringing together organizations throughout the automotive supply chain early in the integration process. For example, with vehicle electrification, adoption of infotainment and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) /automated driving systems (ADS) will soon become as prolific as today\u2019s smart phones and tablets. Designing system-level components and bringing together players to collaborate in the critical integration process is a focus of the ASU site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
