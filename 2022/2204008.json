 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Colin Nuckolls of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will test the hypothesis that open-shell molecules can be used to form molecular wires of virtually any length. These highly conductive molecular wires, have the potential to connect functional molecular electronics (e.g. rectifiers, switches, etc.) to microfabricated electrodes, thus demonstrating a path for integrating molecular electronics and existing circuitry manufacturing. The proposal contains technological broader impacts because it pioneers a new approach to the realistic preparation of single-molecule devices that could be useful across many established and emerging technologies. Beyond the technological broader impacts, this proposal aims to increase the number of scientists as well as bridge related fields with an integrated science/educational program that spans K-8 outreach, curriculum development, and research training for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral scientists. \r\n\r\nThis proposal outlines a new approach to the preparation of ultra-long polyradicaloid molecular wires that become more conductive at longer lengths. Professor Nuckolls and his research group will produce long molecular wires that can be used to interconnect single-molecule elements to carbon nanotube electrodes. Through this proposal, they will synthesize air-stable polyradicaloid wires that can be functionalized and integrated into test structures. Furthermore, the proposed studies will modify the electronic couplings of these wires through their synthetic design. Finally, the studies outlined in the proposal will enable single molecule electrical measurements from these polyradicaloid wire interconnects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
