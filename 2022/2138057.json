 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and portable laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (pLIBS) instruments will be used in Geochemistry research to determine the elemental compositions of soils, sediments, and other environmental media in natural, urban, and human-impacted environments. Rutgers University-Newark is a Hispanic Serving Institution, and supported projects and activities will engage students from diverse backgrounds and foster their participation in place-based research and education. The instruments will be accessible to undergraduate researchers and graduate students, including students participating in NSF-sponsored programs to broaden participation in the Geosciences. Use of the instruments in the field and laboratory will be included in course modules and class projects to enrich the educational experience of students in relevant courses. Ease of use and instrument portability will facilitate inclusion in community- based projects that involve the public in STEM research, and outreach initiatives for education and engagement of K-12 students.\r\n\r\nAcquisition of portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and portable laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (pLIBS) instruments will enhance Geochemistry research by providing in-field non- destructive analysis of elemental concentrations in natural, urban and human-impacted environments. The instrument suite enables quantitative and qualitative analysis of a wide range of elements, including light elements such as carbon. Instrument capabilities will be coupled with complementary laboratory-based and advanced analytical techniques for elemental analysis, speciation, and matrix determination. The pXRF/pLIBS instrument suite will be used in Geochemistry research for in-situ and in-field analyses of heavy metals, major elements and nutrient elements in soils and sediments. Projects to be supported integrate research with education and community engagement, and include heavy metal spatial distribution and speciation in Newark, New Jersey soils; the geochemistry of legacy pollutants in sediments of the New Jersey Meadowlands; and micronutrient and carbon cycling in agricultural soils. Activities and projects will prioritize training of undergraduate researchers and graduate students through local and international research; in courses and as part of a globalized curriculum; and in NSF-sponsored programs that support participation of groups underrepresented in the Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The instrument suite purchased was a SciAps ONE BOX system consisting of a X-505 Soil XRF Analyzer and a SciAps Z-903 GeoChem LIBS Analyzer, which combined covers most elements on the periodic table. The instrument suite facilitated more effective in-field analysis, and sample selection for laboratory-based and advanced analyses.

The data was used to select soils with elevated concentrations of metals such as arsenic and lead for sampling and in-lab analysis to determine speciation, bioavailability and bioaccessibility.

This research required use of the pLIBS and pXRF instruments in the field and the lab to determine the composition of the soil, the amendments and mixed soil-amendment samples. The pXRF provided data on the trace and micronutrient metal content and the pLIBS instrument provided data on the nutrient element composition of the samples and mixtures (Figure 1). The research was continued in the academic year through support from the NSF GSLSAMP program and involved characterizing compost generated at an urban garden hosted by a local high school and evaluating the impact of this amendment on the carbon and nutrient profiles of the garden soils.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NewGeo Project </span>The NSF CTGC Newark Geoscience Ecosystem (NewGeo) is an experiential learning network, connecting academic and non-academic institutions in the city of Newark with the common goal of addressing local and global urban environmental, climate, and geo-challenges through workforce development.
