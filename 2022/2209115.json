 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The focus of this study is on a deadly infectious agent, Cetacean morbillivirus, which has emerged as a serious threat to dolphins, whales, and porpoises and has been a cause of severe outbreaks in cetacean populations around the world in the last 30 years. Many of the cetacean populations in Hawai\u2019i are small and resident and an outbreak from this infection could be especially devastating in this region of the world. Little is known about the exposure and transmission of this virus among marine mammals. This research seeks to better understand the exposure and transmission of Cetacean morbillivirus and will focus on the testing of humpback whales that travel between Hawai\u02bbi and Alaska and other species of dolphins and whales that are resident to Hawai\u02bbi. Understanding the exposure and transmission of this virus in marine animals will provide insights into designing strategies to mitigate disease and aid in the management of Hawaiian populations that may be especially vulnerable disease outbreaks. This research\u2019s broader impact includes providing underrepresented undergraduate students the opportunity to perform scientific research and outreach activities that will target a diverse audience in both the Pacific and Atlantic regions.  \r\n\r\nAerosolization is thought to be the main route for Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) transmission in cetaceans. The proposed work will use serology to conduct antibody testing of fluids taken from 20 species of stranded Hawaiian cetaceans to assess exposure rates. The project will also utilize social networking analysis with data obtained from two decades of cetacean sightings in Hawaiian waters to document mixed-species interactions. This will be paired with exposure data to simulate CeMV spread among Hawai'i's cetacean populations. The fellow will be trained in a foreign laboratory and will have access to a comprehensive training program that includes new laboratory techniques (for example, virus isolation and serology), field-work collection efforts to sample humpback whale exhaled breath, modeling exposure through social networking analysis, classroom teaching, mentoring of summer intern undergraduate students, and communication in science education and outreach. Additionally, one episode of the award-winning Pacific regional TV series Voice of the Sea will be created and broadcast in the Pacific basin and on the island of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
