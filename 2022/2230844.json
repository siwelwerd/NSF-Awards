 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmonic analysis is a foundational subject that touches upon many different areas of mathematics. Much early interest in the subject centered around Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators and the theory connected to them. Recent interest in harmonic analysis has been in the construction of different wavelet bases and utilizing them in medical applications, imaging, and data analysis. The workshop on Harmonic Analysis will take place at Washington University in St. Louis on October 8-9, 2022. The purpose is to bring together researchers in harmonic analysis so that new ideas and past accomplishments in the field can be discussed by both experts and young mathematicians. The conference's principal speaker will provide an overview of some recent developments in real and complex harmonic analysis, including their relations to efficient high dimensional data processing. Other contributions will highlight both recent advances in the area as well as past accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project will be to provide participant support and fund advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D.s, allowing them to attend this major conference on analysis, discuss new ideas, and interact with established researchers. These interactions will be facilitated by the breaks and discussion sessions that will be part of the schedule. Advertisement for the conference will take place on the Department of Mathematics and Statistics website and through email announcements. More information about the conference can be found at the website: http://guidomemorial.wustl.edu\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
