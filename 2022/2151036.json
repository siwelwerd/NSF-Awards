 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of preparing and retaining high-quality science and mathematics teachers. Teachers need to be equipped to teach a diverse population of students for an evolving world, especially in STEM. To further address this need, Science and Mathematics Teachers Initiative Phase 3 (SMTI P3) will partner with a local technical college to provide Scholars with hands-on experiences in their state-of-the-art STEM labs designed to prepare STEM professionals. The project aims to graduate 32 new science and mathematics emerging teacher leaders over five years. Recruitment will include students majoring in mathematics, statistics, biological sciences, chemistry, and physics. This project, which builds upon previously successful Noyce projects at the University of South Carolina, intends to develop Scholars' ability to effectively teach a diverse student population through innovative coursework, research-based interactive seminars, and immersive project-based learning experiences with the project's partnership school districts. Through the engagement of the Scholars in real-world STEM experiences, the project aims to support practicing teachers in authentic STEM classroom instruction. This effective science and mathematics instruction will help to inspire the next generation of STEM professionals.\r\n\r\nThis project at the University of South Carolina includes partnerships with Richland 1 School District, Richland 2 School District, Lexington 2 School District, and Midlands Technical College. Project goals include preparing culturally competent science and mathematics teachers who implement lessons with real-world connections. The project will support STEM undergraduates and STEM post-baccalaureates. SMTI P3 is grounded in a four-part conceptual framework that addresses real-world STEM, STEM content knowledge, classroom experiences, and cultural competence. The project will investigate the impact of real-world STEM experiences on graduates' instructional practices. It also will continue a focus on investigating factors that impact mathematics and science teacher retention in high-need schools. The project's intellectual merit includes using research-based experience from its past projects to capitalize on partnerships with a technical college and high-needs districts to recruit, prepare, and ensure success during induction years for secondary science and mathematics teachers. Broader impacts include empirical evidence validated through the project evaluation, which may result in improved teacher education and retention for secondary science and mathematics teachers for diverse populations. Findings will be disseminated through local and national conferences as well as published in top-tier practitioner and research journals to ensure benefits of the project to the STEM education community. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
