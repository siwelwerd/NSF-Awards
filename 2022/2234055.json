 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support about 60 selected students and recent graduates studying in US institutions from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines to participate in the 2023 co-located International Advanced Manufacturing Conference (NAMRC/MSEC/LEM&P), including the 51st North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC51) sponsored by the North American Manufacturing Research Institution of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2023) sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the International Conference on Leading Edge Manufacturing/Materials & Processing (LEM&P 2023) sponsored by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, to be held at Rutgers\u2013New Brunswick, New Jersey, June 12-16, 2023. These co-located conferences represent the premiere research forum for advanced manufacturing in the U.S. and globe, with topics including conventional and emerging manufacturing technologies, additive manufacturing, nano-/micro-/meso- manufacturing, biomanufacturing, manufacturing equipment and automation, manufacturing systems, quality control and reliability, advanced materials processing, applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence, sustainable manufacturing, life cycle engineering, and engineering education and many other cross-cutting research. As such, this International Advanced Manufacturing Conference acts as a global bridge between industry, government laboratories, and academic institutions.\r\n\r\nParticipation of undergraduate and graduate students as well as recent graduates from U.S. institutions, especially from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and first-generation families, at national manufacturing conferences is crucial to expanding the manufacturing research base in the United States. This award will help lower the barrier for conference participation for selected students by defraying the costs of registration and accommodation. This will enable them to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from industrial and governmental facilities around the world, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international universities. The call-for-award applications will be disseminated through postings on main conference websites and directly by conference organizers, track chairs, and symposium organizers, etc. Submitted applications will go through a selection process by the conference committee, who will prioritize applicants to broaden diversity of participants according to their prior conference involvement, educational institution, and personal background. During the conference, the awardees will be announced in the conference program. This award will enable selected participants to improve their knowledge of advanced manufacturing research and help them become engineers and researchers to lead the next generation of U.S. manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
