 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing plant awareness and professional preparedness among undergraduate students for future careers in botanical sciences. A strong knowledge foundation in plant biology is needed to confront numerous issues of national and global significance (e.g., food security, habitat conservation, climate change mitigation, the biodiversity crisis, and human mental health and well-being). Despite the overwhelming applicability of plant biology, professional and educational training in botany has been in decline since the mid-20th century. This project intends to reinvigorate plant biology at Old Dominion University (ODU), a minority serving institution. The project will enhance course offerings, increase student involvement and representation, and prepare students for individualized futures through tailored mentorship, professional development, and research experiences. Through these actions, this project aims to make significant advances in student recruitment to plant biology courses, research experiences, and professional careers post-graduation. Additionally, this project has potential to increase diversity in ODU\u2019s plant biology courses.\r\n\r\nIn this project, an integrated approach will be implemented for undergraduate plant biology training within a biology department. The approach will emphasize experiential learning opportunities across all academic levels. This project builds on traditional curriculum reform through the formation of an Impact Learning Community focused on plant biology, provision of professional development opportunities, and mentoring of students. Regular assessments of the program and student surveys will aid in determining the effectiveness of experiential learning activities for promoting positive student outcomes in plant biology. The ultimate goal of this project is to increase student opportunities, involvement, and representation in plant biology courses and research experiences at Old Dominion University, thus bolstering knowledge, skills, and confidence in tomorrow\u2019s plant professionals. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
