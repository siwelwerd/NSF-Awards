 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a collaborative-learning platform that generates accurate population health models from secure access to patient records.  The proposed system will overcome privacy concerns to enable AI methods to securely access hundreds of millions of patient records from multiple institutions across the US to learn high-performing predictive models. Models learned from this platform are differentiated due to their training data and help payors, providers, and pharma companies that benefit from early diagnosis and treatment of patients that may have remained undiagnosed. This system will improve patient outcomes and health care system performance. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address fundamental limitations that can deter medical institutions from sharing patient data to support learning clinical-grade models. Unlike federated learning (FL), neither local data nor local model parameters are shared; rather, local classifiers predict labels for an unlabeled global dataset. Sharing model parameters in FL can violate privacy requirements and expose patient data used for local training. This novel platform is designed to be immune to the \u201cwhite box\u201d attacks of FL, and its main privacy risk for membership inference is significantly lower. This platform will accurately include information from all subpopulations and will support collaborative learning for multiple ML algorithms, including human-interpretable algorithms that cannot be learned with FL. Accuracy will be evaluated via sensitivity and specificity, privacy via membership vulnerability. Methods compared include federated learning and differential privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

AIM-HI improves privacy over federated learning (FEDAVG) without compromising on model quality (Fig 1).\n\n\nWe evaluate AIM-HI on 3 benchmark image classification datasets, 2 real medical image classification datasets, and 5 benchmark datasets for interpretable models. We measure empirical privacy vulnerability by performing a large number of membership inference attacks and compute the probability of inferring upon sensitive data, using the ML Privacy Meter tool. A vulnerability of 1.0 means that membership can be inferred with certainty, whereas 0.5 means that deciding on membership is a random guess.\n\n\nPrivacy-Utility-Trade-Off: We first evaluate the performance of AIM-HI and the baselines for deep learning on a homogeneous data distribution for 5 image classification datasets.

AIM- HI converges faster than FEDAVG (Figure 5) though the latter increases its test accuracy slightly further, eventually.\n\n\nPrivacy-Utility Trade-Off With Differential Privacy: DP-AIMHI achieves a high utility in terms of test accuracy even for moderate-to-high privacy levels &#1013; with an accuracy of 0.8 for &#1013; = 0.1 (without any noise, AIM-HI achieves an accuracy of 0.82). A reason for the good trade-off could lie in the robustness of the consensus mechanism to noise (Figure 6).\n\n\nInterpretable Models: A major advantage of AIM-HI over FEDAVG and DD is that it allows training interpretable models that do not lend themselves to aggregation, such as decision trees, and XGBoost.
