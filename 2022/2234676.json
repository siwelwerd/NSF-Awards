 "awd_abstract_narration": "Less than ten years ago, the promise of smart cities seemed endless and ripe with opportunity to improve citizen quality of life through application of technologies such as cameras and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with a layer of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline and optimize operations and outcomes. Since that time, the shine has worn off. Projects often do not go past the pilot stage, are application and context specific, are not implemented at scale, do not explicitly integrate community input during design, planning or operation, and largely consist of isolated platforms or systems of operation without integration. To address these issues, we will hold a workshop focusing on the significant technical, policy and socioeconomic challenges with respect to the integration and scalability of smart city technologies, approaches and/or deployments in real-world settings. Current barriers to integration and/or scaling of the above are likely also related to current policy/regulations, financing, and workforce gaps and as such, they will be considered to inform the research agenda. The workshop will discuss potential solutions to the scalability and integration challenges to help guide future NSF investments in smart cities deployments.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will convene a series of online \u201clistening sessions\u201d with diverse stakeholders from around the United States, including rural, urban and suburban perspectives, to better inform our understanding of the aforementioned challenges. We will use these listening sessions to develop a set of research questions which will be refined in an in-person workshop where we will discuss potential solutions to the scalability and integration challenges (technical and non-technical) to help guide future NSF investments in smart cities deployments. This workshop will foster convergence by engaging participants from academia, government, non-profits, community advocacy, private property owners, civic agencies, and industry, across a range of smart city applications relative to different infrastructure systems. For each of these application areas (such as energy, transportation, water, etc.), we will bring together expertise from engineering, public policy, computer science, and social and decision science, as well as direct input from community leaders and partners. The main intellectual merit of this workshop will be the development of a summary report outlining a multi-disciplinary research agenda (gaps, questions, and proposed research tasks) to overcome the scalability and integration challenges identified throughout the multi-stakeholder discussions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
