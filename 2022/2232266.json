 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award provides support for the 3rd Upstate New York Topology Seminar (UNYTS), which will take place at Syracuse University on Saturday, October 22, 2022. Topology is a thriving and active field of mathematics. This event will help facilitate the creation of a cohesive topology community in New York State and nearby regions. The NSF funding will allow for partial support of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. This in-person opportunity to network with peers and established mathematicians will help mitigate the adverse effects the pandemic has had on the careers of these early researchers. The conference will also allow the entire regional topology community to present their own work, learn about new ideas, develop research collaborations, and build a regional network of scientific contacts. The schedule will have built-in formal and informal networking opportunities for productive discussions to develop naturally from exposure to the talks and from other common interests.\r\n \r\nThis is the third installment of the Upstate New York Topology Seminar series (UNYTS), which was started in Fall 2017 under the name Topology Day. The conference will feature three one-hour long plenary lectures by Francesco Lin, Allison Miller, and Martina Rovelli. These speakers are established and emerging leaders in the fields of Low Dimensional Topology and Algebraic Topology. In addition, there is an open call for contributed talks within the special sessions to be held in the afternoon. More information is available at the conference website at https://clamille.github.io/UNYTS2022.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
