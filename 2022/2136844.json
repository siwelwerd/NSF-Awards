 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the novel scientific knowledge gained by understanding the effects of high electrostatic fields on composite dielectrics, the translation of experimental materials to robust and high performance HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators, and, more generally, the impact of HASEL actuation technology within real-world applications. This knowledge contributes to many highly interdisciplinary fields of science, ranging from electrostatics, materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. The advancements of HASEL actuators achieved during this project may have broad impacts on commercial, research, education, and defense sectors. These actuators may be an enabling component for a variety of industries including automation, automotive, medical devices, robotics, and defense applications. Key features of HASEL actuators include: analog motion, mechanical compliance, high speed, high strain, silent operation, customization, and self-sensing. By bringing forward actuator technologies, industries may adopt robotic technologies, strengthening the economic competitive advantage of these industries. The team will continue to leverage academic partnerships to contribute to and train a highly capable technical workforce of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance the performance of HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators. HASEL actuators harness electrostatic forces to drive shape-change in a soft hydraulic structure, providing a variety of muscle-like actuation modes and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. HASEL actuators address critical problems in existing soft actuator technologies. For example, soft pneumatic actuators must be tethered to a system of valves and pumps for high performance actuation, whereas HASEL actuators are electrically controlled and can be operated with battery-powered portable power supplies. The team will develop and validate approaches to advance the performance and ease of use of HASEL actuators. These advances of the technology will be realized through material optimization, fabrication improvements, and a more fundamental understanding of solid-liquid composite dielectric structures under high electrostatic fields. Performance improvements will be applied to actuators well-suited for industrial, consumer, defense, and experimental applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
