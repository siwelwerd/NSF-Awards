 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the 350 students/year to attend the next two (2) Annual Conferences of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) themed \u201cGrand Unification II \u2013 Emerging from the Event Horizon and Beaming to the Future.\u201d The primary goal of the NSBP is to address the perennial problem of lack of diversity in physics, astronomy, condensed matter and materials research, and related fields such as geophysics. The NSBP Conference aims to provide mentorship opportunities, increase participant access to recruiters, offer networking opportunities and inform the broader physics community on best practices. Also, the NSBP Conferences directly address (1) the NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas, including Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, Windows on the Universe, and the objectives of NSF INCLUDES and (2) the AIP TEAM-UP report recommendation that professional societies work with funding agencies like NSF to commit to achieving the goal of doubling the number of bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and astronomy awarded to African Americans by 2030.  The award is enabled by cross-directorate funds from the Directorate for the Mathematical Sciences, the Directorate for Geosciences, and the Directorate Human Resource Development (HBCU-up program). \r\n\r\nThe mission of the NSBP is to promote the professional well-being of African American physicists and physics students within society at large. The NSBP will build on the experience of the 2020 and 2021 conferences which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had to be completely virtual meetings. The opportunity to make comparisons between face-to-face (2018-2019), online (2020-2021), and hybrid (2022-2023) NSBP conferences will be serendipitous, the silver lining to the onset of a global pandemic. The Conference allows students to have close interactions with professional physicists and gain exposure to high-quality scientific researchers and presentations. NSBP 2022 and 2023 conferences will include a \u201cBig Science Hour\u201d emphasis on the science and technology of Quantum Information Systems (QIS). In addition to being a meeting that promotes the persistence of underrepresented physics students in the academic-workforce pipeline, the NSBP Conferences will inspire the next generation of physics professionals through near-peer role modeling by supporting the virtual attendance of high school students and their teachers. These activities, including year-round mentoring programs, will provide an opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to experience being a near-peer mentor and will allow the high school students to interact with someone they can aspire to become. Thus, the NSBP annual scientific conferences are part of its plan to increase the pool of African American physicists available in the academic pipeline and STEM workforce. NSBP will hold its 2022 (November 6-9) and 2023 conferences in hybrid format (primarily in-person with a virtual component). The award also supports conference evaluation and the impact of the new and expanding virtual format of conferences on increasing participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 2022 Conference of the National Society of Black Physicists, themed &ldquo;Emerging from the Horizon and Beaming for the Future&rdquo; was held in Charlottesville, VA from November 6&ndash;9th. The total attendance consisted of 633 participants with 102 attending virtually. The conference attendees included 367 students and postdocs, 218 faculty/professionals, and 48 exhibitors/sponsors. In partnership with the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Research Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), 287 students were fully supported by NSF. Re-emerged from the COVID-19 abyss, NSBP hosted a breathtaking showcase of Black physicists, which featured Pre-Conference Informational Sessions hosted by NRAO, UVA Physics, Astronomy, and Engineering, Thorlabs and Corning, Inc.</p>\r\n<p>In 2023, the 45th Annual Conference convened in Knoxville, TN, occurring on November 9&ndash;12th. The conference theme was &lsquo;Frontiers in Physics: From Quantum to Materials to the Cosmos,&rsquo; and was held across three venues - Knoxville Convention Center, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The total attendance consisted of 743 participants with 35 attending virtually. The conference attendees included 396 students and postdocs, 267 faculty/professionals, and 80 exhibitors/sponsors. The conference had representation from 103 institutions (universities, national laboratories, professional organizations and companies), including 22 Historically Black Colleges and Universities.&nbsp; A total of 70 sessions were held throughout the event with 37 scientific and 33 professional development, in addition to 3 laboratory tours at the partnering organization sites.</p>\r\n<p>Both NSBP 2022 and 2023 conferences included &ldquo;Big Science Hours&rdquo; with emphasis on the science and technology of Quantum Information Systems (QIS) and the Perspectives and Experiences of African American Women in Physics. Additionally, these conferences featured a Conference App which served as the central node for navigating the conference and the various sessions, presentations, and networking opportunities. Finally, both conferences held research focus groups to better understand the effect of the meeting on improving persistence and participation in the physics field and workforce. The major themes emerged from observations, focus groups and survey data including (1) A Place for Support and Opportunity, (2) Inspirational and Encouraging Sessions, and (3) The Value of Mentorship. Overall, the cross-sectional analysis from both conference evaluations indicate that student participants strongly agree with NSBP conferences positively impacted their decision to persist in physics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/02/2025<br>\nModified by: Willie&nbsp;S&nbsp;Rockward</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233329/2233329_10831335_1735878660370_2022_NSBP_Conference_Group_Photo--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233329/2233329_10831335_1735878660370_2022_NSBP_Conference_Group_Photo--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2022 NSBP conference group photograph\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233329/2233329_10831335_1735878660370_2022_NSBP_Conference_Group_Photo--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2022 NSBP conference group photograph\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: 2022 NSBP conference group photograph at the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rob Garland Studios, LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Willie&nbsp;S&nbsp;Rockward\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 NSBP conference group photograph</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233329/2233329_10831335_1735879964470_2023_NSBP_Conference_Group_Photo_v3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233329/2233329_10831335_1735879964470_2023_NSBP_Conference_Group_Photo_v3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2023 NSBP conference group photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233329/2233329_10831335_1735879964470_2023_NSBP_Conference_Group_Photo_v3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2023 NSBP conference group photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: 2023 NSBP conference group photograph on campus of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Department of Physics, University of Tennessee, Knoxville</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Willie&nbsp;S&nbsp;Rockward\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 NSBP conference group photo</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
