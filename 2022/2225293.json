 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a diverse group of approximately 25 dissertation-stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in an international doctoral consortium with distinguished research faculty. The Communication, Digital Technology, and Organization (CTO) doctoral consortium at the 2022 Academy of Management (AoM) conference will consist of one and a half days of talks and interactions among OCIS students and researchers in Seattle, Washington. The doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-disciplines and communities involved in the AoM conference, the consortium will allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines. Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future interdisciplinary research and their progress toward becoming professional researchers.\r\n \r\nThe CTO division at the annual AoM meeting provides a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations and society. This project provides a forum for doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance in order to enhance the quality of their dissertation research. It also facilitates the establishment of new research collaborations and professional networks and develops a greater awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
