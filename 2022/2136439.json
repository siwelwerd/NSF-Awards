 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a wearable device and associated software that will decrease the cost of care and improve the quality of life of the 1+ M patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, their personal caregivers, and their medical providers.  This project will increase our understanding of Parkinson\u2019s disease and other neurological and motor disorders.  It will reduce current costly treatments with an online solution using the device and associated software. The research objective is to develop the hardware, software application, and database that constitute a complete, working system which will improve the quality of life for Parkinson\u2019s patients and improve the data available for Parkinson\u2019s disease researchers.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a wearable biomedical feedback device that communicates with a mobile application to alert users in real time when a specific physical vocal pathology is detected by the device.  Post-event information can then be evaluated by users and their medical caregivers using a graphical user interface within the mobile application. Data will also be transmitted and stored in a database of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.  Upon addition and refinement of new data, the technical results will include a wearable device, analytic software, and a database will be used to improve and fine-tune the software to improve both the identification, speed, and modality of correction as well as serve a highly valuable database for Parkinson\u2019s researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project created a dataset from over 350 personal interviews and surveys that established the customer base and commercial need for a personal device for adults with Parkinson?s disease to address pathological speech and communication.  Those results have critically informed the technical design features of the system.  This project created a detailed needs analysis of a wearable electronic feedback device and system.  The specifications for such a system were determined in domains of energy, computation, sensors, data transmission, communication, form-factor, and durability.  This project created a detailed engineering scheme for implementing the particulars of the system.  The implementation hardware was designed and coupled with anticipated software needs to bring a viable consumer product to market.  It was previously unknown if a wearable device/system meeting the critical technical needs could be designed and engineered.  An important result is the proof-of-concept meeting all necessary design features with real implementation.  The broader impacts of this work and these products are to create a useful database of market needs and viability that further informs detailed specifications and engineering details necessary to create the system and bring that system to the consumer and to the public.  The broader impacts include specific findings and design specifications that were not previously known and will improve the product for adults with Parkinson?s disease.  The system developed is anticipated to advance healthcare, day to day living, and quality of life for adults with Parkinson?s and their caregivers.  Broader impact is anticipated to reduce the personal and societal healthcare burden while simultaneously improving the quality of life for adults with neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Furman"
