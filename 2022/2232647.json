 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents the convening of leading academic researchers in place-based innovation policy and related areas to provide timely insight for the NSF Regional Innovation Engines program.  Its objective is to bring together a diverse group of researchers and policymakers to i) provide an assessment of the \u201cstate of knowledge\u201d of place-based innovation ecosystems, and its relationship to both geographic and socioeconomic inclusion, ii) identify the insights of this research to inform innovation policymakers, and iii) surface potential means by which to measure and assess place-based innovation ecosystems on a rigorous and ongoing basis. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on regional, place-based innovation economies, and it is divided in two phases. In the first phase of the project, a \u201creading group\u201d would convene on a regular (monthly) basis to assess the \u201cstate of the field\u201d and \u201copen questions\u201d around specific topics in the economics of regional innovation ecosystems.  These meetings would serve as a precursor to the second phase of the project, a one and a half day research conference bringing together top researchers across several areas of interest to summarize the key insights around each topic and discuss key frontier questions in a discussion panel. Summaries of both the reading group meetings and conference will be developed, serving as a basis for future reference in the development of regional innovation ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
