 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) workshop is an annual event with the goal of encouraging participation of junior researchers in integer programming and related areas. The primary goals of this workshop are to showcase young researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students to network with the world's top researchers. This award will provide funds for graduate students to attend the 19th MIP workshop, each of whom will be presenting his or her poster at the workshop. MIP student poster sessions provide students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are recognized. In addition, this year the workshop will introduce a computational competition that will allow students to test their skills on a challenging optimization problem.  This award provides travel support for 10 student poster presenters.  The conference has been a fertile ground for students' professional development, with a number of previous participants supported by NSF now holding faculty positions across the US.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 MIP workshop will be held from May 24 to May 26, 2022 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The solicitation for the poster presentations will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, with particular effort to broaden participation by attracting students from underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for graduate students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in emerging research in the field of MIP.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
