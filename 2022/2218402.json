 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice cores are a vital source of information about past climate. Research that utilizes ice cores benefits from an undamaged ice-core record. There is often a zone within ice sheets where the ice is brittle upon extraction in a core. Brittle-ice behavior occurs when the rapid decompression of the core as it is being extracted from the ice-sheet results in extensive fracturing. Ice from this zone can compromise the undamaged record. This project seeks to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in brittle-ice behavior and onset, with the goal of helping to guide field-site operations, core handling preparation, and planned laboratory measurement techniques for future ice-coring projects, including the upcoming work at Hercules Dome. This project requires no field work, as it will use existing observations and existing ice cores to gain an understanding of brittle ice. This is a high-risk and timely proposal that is early-concept and exploratory in nature, making it appropriate for the EAGER solicitation. The project will support an early-career researcher and provide training for a master\u2019s student who is a woman. And, finally, the project will develop educational and outreach materials for graduate and undergraduate courses and elementary schools.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine and catalog brittle ice from several existing ice-core samples to specifically assess various ice physical properties affecting brittleness potential, including bubble size and number-density, ice fabric, grain statistics, fracture characteristics, and the location and properties of grain and subgrain boundaries. End members of this sample assessment have been identified and include Siple Dome, which exhibited major brittle behavior and damage, and South Pole ice core, which exhibited very-minor brittle behavior and almost no damage. Output datasets will include calibrated relationships for bubble number-density, mean grain and bubble sizes, subgrain prevalence and orientation, and a usable indicator for estimating brittle-ice onset and magnitude. There is an immediate applicability of results from this effort for the Hercules Dome drilling project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Following bubble closure in ice, internal deformation squeezes bubbles, raising their internal air pressure to near the overburden level. Subsequent release of external pressure during core recovery can allow the internal stresses to exceed the ice strength, causing fracturing in what is known as the \"brittle ice zone\" (BIZ). The depth range and degree of brittleness varies greatly between ice cores. Site characteristics including accumulation rate and temperature likely affect brittle ice behavior, but strong correlations are not apparent. Despite prior research, the mechanisms controlling BIZs are still not well-understood.</p>\n<p>Various ice-core observations, together with physical understanding, suggest that BIZ fractures preferentially follow subgrain boundaries, linking bubbles over long distances by way of an interconnected \"chessboard\" pattern of subgrains anchored to the bubbles. This study focused on thin section analyses from the highly brittle Siple Dome ice core, with comparisons to the minimally brittle South Pole ice core. Using targeted image processing techniques and analyses, we identified noteworthy relationships between fractures, subgrain boundaries, and bubbles.</p>\n<p>This study has provided initial insights into brittle-ice behavior and its physical properties and establishes a connection between subgrain prevalence and mean grain/bubble sizes in ice cores, revealing that larger grains/bubbles correlate with more severe brittle behavior. In addition, estimates for the Hercules Dome site suggest a brittle-ice zone between 625-1200 m depth with a brittleness factor of ~2 out of 5 (information that will undoubtedly be of high value for the upcoming drilling campaign). Several new algorithms were also developed as part of this project in RStudio for calculating the relevant chessboard statistics that will be publicly shared. Lastly, a catalog of new physical properties data related to brittle-ice behavior and onset were assimilated into a singular (and searchable) database. This will allow for many additional future analyses.</p>\n<p>More specifically, we found that that subgrain chessboards and identified \"Saturn bubbles\" correlate with mean grain size in ice and that these two features were also found to more likely exist together within parent grains, when also found in greater numbers. As such, for Siple Dome--the sample with the largest mean grain area&nbsp;and incidence of both \"Saturn bubbles\" and subgrain chessboards--58.5% of all grains contained either subgrain chessboards or \"Saturn bubbles,\" but with both occurring together 94.3% of the time, and in 55.1% of the total observed grains.</p>\n<p>The majority of observed bubble \"Saturn cracks\" in the highly-brittle Siple Dome(SDMA) thin section, were also revealed to preferentially aligned in a manner consistent with a bulk vertical c-axis fabric within the measured section. Maximum brittle-ice behavior is likely influenced greatly by a vertical alignment of grains, at depths favorable for subgrain chessboards formation where vertical compression dominates. And while c-axis measurements were unable to be directly measured in this study, the uniformity of individual grain colors observed through cross-polarizers, along with published fabrics for similar depths by others (e.g. Gow and Meese; 2007), suggest that the overwhelming majority of crystallographic basal planes in the SDMA sample do align horizontally.</p>\n<p>One of the most useful scientific takeaways from this project was the development of a first-generation \"ice brittleness\" model that will allow future ice core project teams to estimate the expected brittleness for proposed coring sites (see Figure 1).</p>\n<p>As a result of this project, first generation graduate student Samantha Barnett completed her MS thesis in Geology at Northern Arizona University (NAU).

As part of her research, Samantha spent several weeks working at the NSF Ice Core Facility in Lakewood, Colorado preparing multiple thin sections for analysis. During this time, she also was mentored by USGS glaciologist and ice fabric pioneer, Dr. Joan Fitzpatrick.
