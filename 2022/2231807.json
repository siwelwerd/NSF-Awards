 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological activities in multicellular systems, such as microbial biofilms and cancerous tumors, are heterogeneous, dynamic, and adaptive. Resolving complex spatiotemporal biological processes in multicellular systems is crucial for biology studies and medical applications. One of the significant challenges for having a holistic picture of systems biology lies in the lack of real-time spatiotemporal biochemical characterization methods for living multicellular systems. This research aims to develop an innovative mesh-based biosensor to allow spatiotemporal biochemical monitoring of system-level biological activities in multicellular systems, such as microbial biofilms. This project incorporates outreach activities through lab tours and science demos coordinated by the Virginia Tech Sustainable Nanotechnology center to engage public interest and promote research dissemination in biosensing topics. In addition, the team will collaborate with the Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity to promote STEM academic diversity through the \"Imagination Summer Camp\" program for K12 students from rural areas and \"Women's Preview Weekend\" for admitted female high school students. \r\n\r\nBiological activities in multicellular systems, such as microbial biofilms and cancerous tumors, are heterogeneous, dynamic, and adaptive, coordinated by cellular interactions via different signaling and regulatory pathways. Unfortunately, standard bioanalysis methods do not allow in situ spatiotemporal biochemical monitoring of multicellular systems due to their invasiveness. This project develops a biomimetic microporous mesh-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) biosensor to integrate uniform nanoplasmonic hotspot arrays within multicellular biofilm systems and enable in situ spatiotemporal SERS biochemical monitoring of system-level biofilm activities. The research includes two research objectives: (1) develop biomimetic nanoplasmonic mesh SERS biosensors to incorporate large uniform hotspot arrays within biofilms for reliable spatiotemporal SERS measurements in nontargeted molecular profiling and targeted pH sensing, and (2) implement in situ spatiotemporal SERS molecular profiling and pH sensing of biofilm activities during biofilm development and after antibiotic treatment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
