 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Differential Geometry and Geometric Analysis\" will take place from June 20-24, 2022 in Florence, Italy. Geometric analysis has been very active in recent years, with numerous results resolving some old conjectures and producing new examples. The event will bring together world experts to discuss these recent developments and possible research directions motivated by the new techniques that were discovered. This grant will allow the organizers to support the travel and accommodation of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients from the US. The conference is meant to bring American, German, and Italian communities in differential geometry together and to promote international collaborations. It will also give an opportunity for younger mathematicians to interact with senior experts in the area in a relaxed environment.\r\n\r\nThe organizers of the conference selected several topics in differential geometry that focus on the most recent developments. Among these are:\r\n\u2022 Manifolds with lower curvature bounds, including sectional and Ricci curvature\r\n\u2022 Metric spaces with synthetic notions of curvature below or above\r\n\u2022 Geometric flows, including Ricci flow and mean curvature flow\r\n\u2022 Special geometries, including Einstein metrics, soliton metrics, and metrics with special holonomy\r\n\u2022 Minimal hypersurfaces and solitons for the mean curvature flow\r\nAll information about the conference will be available on the conference website: https://www.dma.unifi.it/~verdiani/dgga2022/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
