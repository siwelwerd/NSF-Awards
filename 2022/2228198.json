 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build on an existing model for cultural transformation in the geosciences that has been developed by the Center for Diverse Leadership in Science. The social context of doing science is emphasized through leadership development, the practice of team-based science, and through intentional relationships and partnerships that disrupt traditional hierarchies. One component of this effort will study how to impact people to grow their awareness of and respect for different knowledge systems in geoscience, and pro-social skills, to thereby have the capacity for healthy, effective, transdisciplinary geoscience research and practice. The project leaders will examine the impact of the program on participants\u2019 identities as scientists and cultural change agents. The program activities will focus on moving cohorts of early career fellows through the educational and career trajectory being intentional about their environment, and providing mentorship with peers, previous trailblazers, and trained faculty for leadership, modeling, and network development. Project leaders will maintain continuity and health in relationships with people and partners, including regional community-based organizations, tribal authorities, and minority-serving institutions, so they can continue to steer efforts for community-driven science, engaged research, and respectful collaborative experiences. At the same time, project leaders will support community- and network-building initiatives led by early career fellows, including the Environmental Justice Working Group, Veterans in Green STEM, and the Navajo Scholars Network. Project leaders will continue to organize and work to engage departments, universities, and professional societies in the shared learning and practices in support of equity, cultivating institutional contexts by impacting professionalization processes and implementing change strategies.\r\n\r\nThe project will engage geoscience early career fellows, community experts who are honorary fellows, faculty fellows, and core staff, adding to more than 100 individuals per year. This project will provide opportunities for empowering, supporting, and retaining people from structurally excluded groups in earth system science and green STEM fields, including people of color, LGBTQIA+, veteran, and disabled geoscientists and community members, to become the innovators, scientific, and social leaders needed by society. This work will build capacity in the geosciences and in academic and non-academic institutions for community-centered work relating to environmental science and justice that includes diverse ways of knowing and knowledge creation. Project leaders will train the next generation of geoscientists, who will learn from each other, from academics, and from community experts, thereby contributing to workforce development and innovative science. The fellows will grow and apply their knowledge of geoscience and enhance their skills as leaders and champions of diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, access, and belonging. Project leaders propose that cultivating leadership skills through communities of learning and practice will not only have immediate impact but will enable the network of environment- and community-focused scholars to share their experiences and lessons learned with their peers and mentees for years to come. This project will support sustainable and equitable partnerships between the Center, universities, community-based organizations, and tribal authorities, and the activities will have impact beyond participating institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
