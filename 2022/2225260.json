 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis grant will fund travel for students and post-doctoral fellows who are US citizens to attend the Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Workshop, to be held over five days in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina from June 5 to June 9, 2022. This is the 20th in the series of Hilton Head Workshops on the science and technology of solid-state sensors, actuators, and microsystems. It is an exciting multidisciplinary event that has occurred biennially since 1984 with a rich history going back to the establishment of the field of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The main theme of the workshop is Grand Challenges in Engineering and how microsystems technologies in combination with other technologies can address these challenges. Topics such as industrial short courses, MEMS and Sensors Industry Group (MSIG) special session, and early faculty development will also be addressed in special sessions within the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe travel awards enabled by this NSF grant provide travel assistance to US citizen students and post-doctoral associates of various groups including those underrepresented in science and engineering. The PIs will select travel award winners from the list of accepted papers paying close attention to diversity and inclusion including outreach to microsystems faculty in HBCUs, HSIs and 4-year Undergraduate in Engineering programs. The Workshop will benefit students with interest in academic and industrial careers as well as active faculty members. It is important to provide an inclusive climate for the participants and to help expand their network of professional contacts to ensure their future success. The hope is that they will return to their institutions inspired by their interactions and the technical content they witness at the workshop under the guidance of workshop leaders. The impact to the profession is recruitment and retention of well-informed personnel that feel supported and empowered. The website developed for the workshop will provide information about its activities and the organizing committee.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
