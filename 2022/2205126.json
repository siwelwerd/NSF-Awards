 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry of our Universe is dominated by carbon molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  As much as a quarter of all carbon - perhaps the most important element for life - is contained in these chemicals. In this project, a dedicated astrochemistry program will explore the chemical pathways leading to complex PAHs.  The investigators will focus on the observations of cold, dark molecular clouds where PAHs are found in abundance.  These clouds are sites of the earliest stages of star formation, which hints that these molecules may play a large role in the chemistry of young stars and planets. Radio telescopes will be used to search for more PAHs in this region in space, and computer machine learning approaches will be developed to help us understand the chemistry. Data products and computer code the investigators create will be released freely and publicly.  The investigators will share their research to the public through a series of online seminars.\r\n\r\nThe presence of PAHs in cold clouds is surprising, as it has long been thought that they are predominantly formed in the high-temperature envelopes of evolved stars.  The extremely high-sensitivity, high-resolution spectroscopic line survey that has enabled this first wave of discoveries is only the tip of the iceberg. The investigators will continue analysis of these data, including searching for new PAHs and other chemically related species and create a novel machine learning approach to predicting and exploring interstellar chemical inventories. These projects will interface closely with laboratory spectroscopy and astrochemical modeling aspects with a large collaboration of astronomers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
