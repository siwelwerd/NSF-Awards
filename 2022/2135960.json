 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to enhance the training and mentoring of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates. It will strengthen connections among researchers at different career stages and in different research areas within algebraic and geometric topology and related disciplines. Important outcomes for the project are the development of structured feedback mechanisms for students and postdocs, expansion of professional development opportunities, increasing research collaboration amongst the graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, strengthening connections between the topology group at Michigan State University and those at peer institutions, and broadening access to graduate school for undergraduates. The activities are designed to have a lasting impact on the RTG participants as well as the broader topology research community.\r\n\r\nThe project will incorporate four additional postdoctoral researchers, as well as supporting the research of twelve graduate students. Undergraduates will also be increasingly integrated into the activities of the topology group through the creation of a summer directed reading program and an undergraduate peer mentoring program. Inclusive mentoring and feedback processes for graduate students and postdocs will be introduced, as well as extensive professional development opportunities. Small groups of faculty, postdocs, and students will make extended visits to peer institutions to build stronger ties and broaden the impact of the research training group beyond the boundaries of the university. Other activities include structured vertical collaborations and new courses, seminars, and workshops, benefiting graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
