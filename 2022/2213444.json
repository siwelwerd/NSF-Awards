 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Eller and his students at California State University Northridge (CSUN) in Northridge, CA will develop new analytical tools for examining nanoparticles and molecular arrangements at scales approaching 5 nanometers. Examining these materials with high spatial resolution will provide critical insights into fundamental and materials processes occurring at the nanoscale. Professor Eller will broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM research through two approaches focused on providing hands-on experiences. (1) Developing a new mass spectrometry laboratory course and (2) providing outreach opportunities to local K-12 students.\r\n\r\nProfessor Eller will develop new analytical methods for nanoscale molecular analysis based on secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The research will investigate the use of massive gold clusters as SIMS projectiles to examine nanoparticles and molecular assemblies, with the goal of elucidating molecular organization at a scale approaching 5 nm. The results of the project will provide new insights into nanoparticle-surface interactions with low-dimensional materials and nanostructured surfaces. Professor Eller will develop an interconnected research and educational program which will work in concert with CSUN\u2019s institutional goal of encouraging students from underrepresented groups to actively participate and succeed in STEM research fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
