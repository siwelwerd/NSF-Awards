 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project will significantly reduce the energy consumption and equipment failure in conveyor systems. The proposed project advances a new coating technology that is more environmentally sustainable than currently used petroleum-based oil lubricants. This technology will enable applications in other fields and produce tremendous savings in multiple industries. The project will further provide extensive education and leadership training in innovation and entrepreneurship to graduate and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. They will gain the required knowledge and skills for leading high-tech startup companies.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project advances a method to bond graphite coatings tightly to a substrate, which has not been possible previously. This project will address several technical challenges in the development of the coating technology for belt conveyor applications. The specific objectives are to 1) develop and optimize fast coating deposition processes on conveyor materials, 2) develop scalable coating processes for full-size conveyor materials, 3) build a prototype belt conveyor for evaluating the coating performance, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of the developed coatings for belt conveyor applications. This research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of how coating deposition parameters and coating composition affect coating morphology, thickness, adhesion to the substrate, cohesion, friction, and durability. The expected technical outcome is the production of dry-lubricated conveyor belts and slider bed materials that show a friction and durability improvement of at least 50% over uncoated materials in a prototype conveyor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
