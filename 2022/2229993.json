 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for selected students and post-doctoral scholars to attend the Symposium of Additive Manufacturing Modeling, Simulation, and Machine Learning at the Materials Science & Technology 2022 (MS&T22) conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 9-13 October 2022. The Symposium of Additive Manufacturing Modeling, Simulation, and Machine Learning is one of the key symposia at the MS&T22 conference. Additive manufacturing technologies continue to expand manufacturing capabilities in the U.S industry with competitive advantages. Although there have been multiple advances in the AM field, challenges in predictive theoretical and computational approaches still hinder the widespread adoption of additive manufacturing technologies in the industry. This symposium will present and discuss the latest studies in additive manufacturing modeling, simulation, and machine learning research. Through participating in this symposium, selected students and post-doctoral scholars are expected to be immersed in a unique intellectual environment, including technical presentations by renowned international experts in the additive manufacturing field, and interactions with leading additive manufacturing researchers around the world.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this award is to provide the selected students and post-doctoral scholars with a unique opportunity to become involved in and familiar with the additive manufacturing research community through symposium participations. In addition to acquiring knowledge and an appreciation of the breadth of additive manufacturing, involvements with professional conferences and societies will motivate their intellectual curiosity, through developing a network of professional contacts and resources. Such networking will continue to support students and post-doctoral scholars in the long term, throughout their professional careers. The project will particularly reach out to students and post-doctoral scholars from underrepresented groups when broadcasting this participation opportunity, targeting their involvement and ultimate retention in careers related to additive manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
