 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). The award supports Texas Southern University (TSU) in a partnership with the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics (CTBP, Rice University) in a collaborative research and training program.  This collaboration will impact students from underrepresented and underserved communities, as is consistent with the largest segment of the student population on the TSU campus (greater than 80%). This NSF-PREP project is aimed at improving the retention and academic preparedness of graduates who successfully go to graduate school, medical school or successful biophysics careers and related sciences.  Research projects concern the effect of low dose radiation on cells and their genetics, with a focus on developing collaborations particularly in the areas of fundamental modeling of chromatin structure and dynamics, and modeling of gene signaling networks coming from the CTBP side. The funded activities integrate Texas Southern faculty and student efforts and training with the activities of the CTBP. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration has two main research projects: (1) Determining mechanisms that affect cell proliferation at low x-ray doses consistent with diagnostic imaging energies and (2) Understanding how low dose x-rays affect leukocytes, post-exposure molecular response pathways and repair mechanisms and phenotypic impact on cell proliferation. The objectives will be accomplished by emphasizing three distinct thrusts: (1) computational modeling and theory-based investigation of changes in biologically relevant processes, linear energy transfer (LET) and Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) engendered by x-ray irradiation in realistic leukocyte cell morphologies consisting of liquid water at relatively low doses, (2) experimental and computational evaluation of radiation damage at the DNA scale due to x-ray irradiation at relatively low doses, and (3) validation and testing of computational models with biological experiments exploring the functional impact of low dose x-rays on protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions.  Establishment of a strong partnership between TSU and the CTBP will provide a pipeline for a high-achieving and diverse student population with training in theoretical biophysics and experimental radiation biology research to continue to graduate or medical school, respectively.  The dual aspect of student mentors in active learning and research experiences are primary components of this targeted endeavor. For all students, most of the attrition occurs in the first two years of college, when students are taking introductory gateway courses. The grant will enable TSU to create and build a successful biophysics program in partnership with the CTBP.  TSU is located within Houston and is one of the largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the nation.  Underrepresented STEM students will naturally be impacted by the academic and research thrusts outlined in the proposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
