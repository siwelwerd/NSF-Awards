 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric Science Education Research (ASER) aims to improve teaching and learning in atmospheric science through evidence-based knowledge and practices. However, the atmospheric science community has yet to broadly encourage this type of scholarship or the use of evidence-based practices in teaching and learning, and awareness of this important work still lags behind other disciplines.  This conference will equip atmospheric science educators with knowledge and skills in education research by pairing atmospheric science educators with education researchers. Research projects developed during the workshop will be developed in consultation with education research experts. This will increase the rigor of research being conducted on teaching and learning in atmospheric sciences and set the foundation for increased collaboration on teaching and learning projects in the future. The conference will provide training and professional development opportunities for those interested in pursuing or advancing their skills in ASER. Graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities engaged in or interested in ASER will be particularly invited to this meeting to develop their knowledge of the ASER discipline and formulate the future of education research.\r\n\r\nThe National Association of Geoscience Teachers recognizes the unique research needs of the atmospheric science education community. In the Community Framework for Geoscience Education Research, Grand Challenge #5 specifically calls for activities to broaden the relatively small number of faculty in atmospheric and related sciences engaged in educational research.  This two- and half-day conference has two overarching goals: 1) Enhance the education research skills of atmospheric science educators through training provided by education research experts and 2) encourage collaborations between education research experts, current ASER scholars, and atmospheric science educators that will lead to well-designed education research projects with concrete goals and deadlines.  The conference topics will introduce participants to education research on the science of teaching and learning and discipline based educational research continuum, human subjects research and consent processes, qualitative methods, statistical analysis for social science research including instrument validation, research design, theoretical frameworks and strategies to fund educational research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
