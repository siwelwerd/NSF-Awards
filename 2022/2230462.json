 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs. Quantum science and a quantum literate workforce is a growing field of critical importance for the nation. The current workforce is not meeting the needs of industry in preparing for the emergence of quantum technologies, while individuals from historically underrepresented groups constitute less than one percent of the current quantum workforce. To address these issues, Morgan State University and the National Quantum Literacy Network aim to bring together HBCUs, industry, national laboratories, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations to provide awareness of the critical necessity of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the quantum workforce. With a focus on education, the conference aims to explore new and emerging teaching and learning tools and technologies to rapidly develop a quantum literate workforce and address the hyper-disparities of historically underrepresented groups. This project is aligned with the goals of the HBCU-UP program in building opportunities for HBCU undergraduate students in emerging STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe five-day hybrid conference seeks to address objectives centered around quantum science awareness and opportunities, the critical importance of including HBCUs, other minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and minority business enterprises in quantum science initiatives, introducing the Serious Gaming Initiatives for Quantum Literacy Education as an innovative educational strategy, and highlighting talented and diverse undergraduate students, including ROTC students and community college students. Daily conference themes focusing on Education, Workforce Development, Public Policy, Government, and Industry aim to provide broad coverage of societal arenas. The project will include formative and summative evaluation activities that include pre- and post-workshop assessments and surveys conducted six-months after the conference. Conference proceedings will be published, focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion in quantum literacy efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
