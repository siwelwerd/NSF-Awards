 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Solving Societal Grand Challenges with Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Delaware will work with ten students per year. Traditionally, the societal impact of research breakthroughs led by electrical and computer engineering (ECE) have been self-contained within the discipline (for example, wireless communications, integrated circuits, the Internet, and smartphones). This landscape is rapidly changing, with disciplinary research breakthroughs that align with broader global challenges. The Site will offer a set of research projects that span the broad range of ECE subdisciplines, while directly aligning with broader impact areas defined by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges. This approach will provide context for student participants, showcase the connection and impact of ECE on improving lives, increase motivation for their studies, and help to broaden the base and appeal of ECE to a diverse population. The recruitment will target a diverse and talented cohort of undergraduates from institutions with limited research opportunities, with emphasis on local institutions with predominantly undergraduate programs, community colleges, and HBCUs. These partnerships will provide new opportunities for students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering to pursue engineering and career pathways.\r\n\r\nThis three-year REU Site: Solving Societal Grand Challenges with Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Delaware will will develop a cohort of 10 undergraduate students annually to research defined scientific questions in the field of ECE, ranging from computer engineering to nanoelectronics to signal processing and machine learning. Each project will feature a critical research question with societally relevant impacts. Specific foci for research areas include the ability to advance machine learning techniques for medical imaging and cybersecurity, advance signal processing techniques for neuroscience and detection of cyber-attacks, explore new semiconductor devices for solar and thermal energy conversion, and develop new tools for scientific computation and cybersecurity education. The projects will employ active learning, where students will receive specific training on scientific literature searches, scientific processes, and effective science communicating strategies. The program will allow the undergraduate students to gain valuable experience in research, scientific inquiry, and to develop technical and methodological skills to succeed in graduate STEM studies or future career paths.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
