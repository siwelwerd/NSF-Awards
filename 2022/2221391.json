 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by strengthening collaborations and planning for a future Track 3 S-STEM proposal that will support the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Dabney S. Lancaster Community College, Danville Community College, Longwood University, Virginia Western Community College, and two additional Virginia Community College System institutions. To address the nation\u2019s and Virginia\u2019s increasing demand for STEM professionals and, at the same time, consider the unique needs of rural communities, these institutions will develop a detailed plan to support students in rural Virginia as they earn their associate\u2019s degrees and transition to earn their STEM bachelor\u2019s degrees. In this one-year planning period, the project will work to strengthen existing partnerships and hold a collaborative STEM Summit focused on rural students.  The Track 3 S-STEM proposal that will arise from this effort will be informed by high school and industry partners. This future proposal will also include rigorous research and evaluation efforts aimed at assessing project outcomes and generating important new knowledge for the STEM education community. The project team will build on the strong foundation of Virginia\u2019s statewide transfer initiative and emphasize the importance of both expanding transfer pathways and increasing rural student opportunities and accomplishments in the STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this planning project is to strengthen collaborations and prepare for a future Track 3 proposal to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Aspiring STEM students in rural communities face challenges that include unreliable access to high-quality internet, unequal access to advanced high school coursework, and financial obstacles for many families, school systems, and communities. This project will engage students, faculty and staff members, high school teachers, and industry partners to better understand the strengths, needs, and challenges of low-income students in Virginia\u2019s southern and southwestern communities. Faculty and staff members will work to identify specific and achievable strategies for engaging aspiring STEM students.  The project will design a Track 3 S-STEM proposal that includes rich support services for community college students, provides significant scholarship funding, and facilitates scholars\u2019 transfer to a four-year STEM program. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nStudents in rural communities who aspire to be STEM professionals face unique and important challenges, as do the institutions of higher education that seek to support them in their academic journeys. To better understand the needs of low-income students in rural communities in the Southside and Southwest regions of Virginia, faculty and staff members from seven community colleges (New River, Mountain Gateway, Wytheville, Virginia Highlands, Patrick and Henry, Southside Virginia, and Virginia Western) joined colleagues from the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center and Longwood University to build a foundation for stronger, clearer STEM transfer pathways.\r\n\n\nDubbed Bridging Rural Access in Virginia (BRAVA), this project has the long-term goal of cultivating an ecosystem of support services and providing significant scholarship funding to support students in rural Virginia as they earn their associates degrees and transition to earn their STEM bachelors degrees. To build momentum toward that goal, a cross-institutional team engaged an external evaluator to complete a robust assessment of the experiences of STEM transfer students and the faculty and staff members who work with them. That assessment provided key insights as to the financial, academic, and personal challenges our students face. In addition to that objective outside perspective, nearly 40 professionals joined forces in a regional STEM Summit hosted by Virginia Western Community College. Those academic advisors, dual-enrollment coordinators, student-support personnel, academic administrators, and STEM faculty members worked to identify opportunities and challenges for a meaningful, long-term partnership. Key outcomes of the BRAVA STEM Summit included 1) a Big Ideas synthesis with actionable items for individual institutions and the partnership writ large and 2) a plan for submission of an S-STEM Track 3 proposal in 2025.\r\n\n\nAt its core, the BRAVA project is focused on broadening participation in college and university STEM programs by supporting low-income students in rural communities. This S-STEM Collaborative Planning grant supported the setting of a foundation that will be built upon in the near and long term so that more rural students have opportunities for degree attainment and STEM careers.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlixDFink\n"
