 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole (or in part) under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). It supports the renewal and continuation of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of Rochester. The site supports ten undergraduate students per year for ten weeks of summer research in the general areas of physics, astrophysics and optics with direct research in the sub-fields of neutrino and particle physics, cosmology and particle astrophysics, optics and quantum optics, condensed matters, plasma physics, and geophysics. Individual guidance and mentoring fostered within the faculty's research groups provides each participating student with the skills to navigate the world of science such as giving scientific talks or writing articles well, which will lead to the participants\u2019 intellectual development as an independent researcher.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the REU is to offer undergraduate students throughout the nation the opportunity to take part in physics research over a range of topics. Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, and social outings and may also take part in the Department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
