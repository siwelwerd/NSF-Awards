 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large federally funded surveys have long provided critical insights into economic conditions, public health, and democratic political participation. However, social and technological changes have led to declining survey response rates and other challenges that can threaten the accuracy and increase the cost of these surveys. To address these challenges, this research develops a transparent, adaptive, and data-driven approach for generating valid, reliable, and cost-effective survey results. We assess this method by conducting a survey during the 2022 midterm elections using items from the American National Election Study (ANES) as a  project that will serve as a model to inform the design of future surveys to improve accuracy, validity, and cost-effectiveness. This research also benefits the public by making the data publicly available in easy-to-understand formats. \r\n\r\nWe selected several organizations or teams of researchers who submitted proposals to collaborate on a 2022 midterm survey, with each organization or team asking a core set of identical questions, while also being encouraged to use innovative methods to generate accurate and representative data in a cost-effective manner. The different surveys allow us to assess the costs and quality associated with different survey modes and samples. By requiring a hybrid probability/non-probability sampling approach, this research allows for substantially increasing the sample size and field period of surveys, while providing critical insights into the relative accuracy of different sampling methods. This project provides researchers, survey experts and public stakeholders with an unprecedented ability to analyze national and state-level election dynamics and changes among different segments of the electorate, while offering an open, transparent assessment of the leading methods in the industry to inform current and future surveys.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
