 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mountains cover 20% of Earth's land and shelter nearly half of Earth's biodiversity \u2018hotspots.\u2019 They support abundant animals and plants and provide water to about half of humanity. Mountain peoples possess deep understanding of their extreme environments in which they face threats from warming climates, declining snowpacks and melting glaciers, increasing wildfire, and other challenges. This project establishes the Mountain Science Operating with Society (MtnSOS) network that works with diverse mountain peoples to develop strategies for sustaining their lands and livelihoods. MtSOS brings together 19 networks from six continents and over 50 countries.  This group is comprised of mountain peoples, scientists, and local experts who work together to identify adaptations for environmental change, empower local voices to improve policies and governance, and develop problem-solving approaches toward mountain sustainability. This project strengthens international scientific collaboration by understanding linkages between local and Indigenous knowledge systems, nature-based solutions, and governance structures. MtSOS provides societal benefits through research on transformations to sustainability in mountain ecosystems by integrating science with diverse practices, knowledge, and participants. \r\n\r\nThe MtnSOS network science goals address four critical knowledge gaps for mountain sustainability: 1) contributions of local and Indigenous knowledge to adaptation and transformation; 2) nature-based solutions for climate change in mountain systems; 3) approaches to strengthen local governance, and build equitable partnerships for sustainable livelihoods and policy, and 4) synthesis across diverse mountain contexts of transformative pathways.  The networks within the network leverage RCN and INCLUDES projects, science-based mountain networks, local and Indigenous knowledge networks, team science networks, and education-based networks. The network expands convergence research into a new model of science called Transformative Science with Society to integrate science with action. A Machine Learning component uses integrated datasets to quantify mountain characteristics and allows participants to explore pathways to sustainable futures. The Transformative Science with Society approach improves equity and access and creates a structured process to expand collective impact. Early career individuals receive leadership training, participate in network exchanges, and engage in the policy process of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  MtnSOS supports planning and implementation of societally relevant research such as improved conservation of mountain resources and expands public participation in sustainability sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
