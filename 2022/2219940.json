 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an electronic management system for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery packs. This proposed battery management system has the potential to enable the prognostics, health management, and life-prolonging control of Li-S batteries, thereby accelerating the safe commercial deployment of this chemistry. From a commercial perspective, Li-S batteries are appealing because they can store a significant amount of energy per unit weight, which is important for cost-effective electrification in the aerospace, drone, robotics, transportation, and grid industries. The abundance of sulfur in the earth\u2019s crust is also attractive from a sustainability, cost, supply chain perspective, and societal perspective. A battery management system optimized for emerging chemistries, such as the proposed Li-S chemistry, also has the potential to maximize overall system performance, safety, and longevity, leading to both societal benefits from safer energy storage and potential commercial benefits, including improved insurability. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a reconfigurable model-based battery management system for the prognostics, health management, and health-conscious control of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Li-S batteries have a theoretical energy density of around 2600 Wh/kg, substantially higher than typical Li-ion batteries. Instead of requiring expensive, rare raw materials such as cobalt, Li-S batteries use sulfur, the most abundant material in the earth\u2019s crust, as their main cathode material. Therefore, from the perspectives of energy density, environmental friendliness, and economics, Li-S technology may offer advantages over lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The project builds on earlier research exploring the development of computer simulation models of Li-S batteries, the fitting and validation of these models versus laboratory test data, and the development of algorithms for estimating the current state of charge in Li-S batteries. Together, these innovations open the door to the potential development of a cohesive battery management system that provides monitoring and control functionalities, including the ability to balance the states of charge of different Li-S cells to prevent over-charge and over-discharge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project explored a hypothesis-driven customer discovery effort in the field of model-based, life-prolonging control for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The Li-S battery chemistry is known for its excellent specific energy, especially in comparison to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Specific energy is the amount of energy a battery can store per unit mass.  Batteries with high specific energies are potentially attractive for applications requiring highly mobile energy storage.  The goals of this project were to explore the degree to which there may be a market need for Li-S batteries, the specific market segments where such a need may exist, and the degree to which life-prolonging control can facilitate the commercialization of the Li-S chemistry.  A hypothesis-driven approach was used for exploring these technology commercialization questions, where more than 100 industry experts were interviewed to gain a better understanding of market needs and the value proposition of Li-S control.  These experts were interviewed both through Zoom and at industry events/conferences.  The experts came from the automotive industry, the battery industry, the energy systems industry, the battery software industry, and the biomedical device industry.  The project\u2019s primary conclusion is that there is a growing need for both Li-S batteries and their life-prolonging control in specific industry segments where specific energy is mission-critical, such as the electrified drone industry.  The intellectual merit of the underlying scientific work stems from the fact that Li-S battery control requires novel algorithm development, given the complex chain of underlying reactions in these batteries.  The broader impact of this project stems from the identification of drone electrification, in particular, as a commercialization pathway not only for Li-S batteries but also their life-prolonging control. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hosam Fathy"
