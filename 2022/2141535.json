 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stream ecosystems store, process, and transport organic matter produced in adjacent terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in northern temperate zones dominated by deciduous forests. The most stable, year-round source of organic matter to streams is dissolved organic matter or DOM, which is both transported by and transformed in these streams. Much of the organic matter is broken down by bacteria and other microbes, releasing carbon dioxide as part of the process. As a result, streams are important sources of carbon dioxide efflux to the atmosphere, with consequences for the global carbon cycle. Linking the supply and characteristics of DOM with dynamics of microbial assemblages is necessary to mechanistically integrate streams into global models of carbon cycling. However, DOM is a complex mixture of molecules with different structures and degradability, and microbial assemblages are complicated mixtures of species. This project brings together a team bridging ecosystem science, microbial and molecular biology, environmental chemistry, and data science to conduct controlled laboratory experiments to ask: How do complex microbial communities work together to process complex mixtures of DOM molecules in the environment, and can relationships between microbial communities and DOM characteristics explain rates of carbon dioxide emission? The broader impact activities expand data science training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through a combination of research internships and guided workshops.\r\n\r\nAdvances in analytical and computational techniques have accelerated research characterizing the composition of DOM and assemblages of microbes that degrade DOM in aquatic environments. Methods to characterize these mixtures vary in resolution and can generate vast amounts of multi-dimensional data that are a challenge to interpret independently, let alone together or through time. The project builds simplified experimental systems using model DOM and enriched microbial assemblages to build machine learning models that predict carbon dioxide emissions. Microbial assemblages are being characterized with 16S sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics, while DOM mixtures are characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry, along with fluorescence spectroscopy. This project is unique in placing equal analytical weight on DOM composition and microbial assemblages, and overcomes the challenge posed by multidimensional datasets by weaving tools and disciplinary understanding from ecosystem ecology, computational biology, and environmental chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
