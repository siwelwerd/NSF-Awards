 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  Natalie N. Sanchez  is awarded a NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Sanchez supports her research project entitled \"MPS-Ascend: Disentangling the Complexities of Galaxy Evolution Using Genetically Modified Galaxies\", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Carnegie Observatories, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrew Benson.\r\n\r\nDecades of observations have shown that large scale gas outflows driven by energetic processes are critical in galaxy evolution. Such flows inhibit and regulate  star formation. Stellar feedback from supernova and stellar winds is an important source of energy for driving outflows as are winds from Super Massive Black Holes (SMBH). Amidst the complicated backdrop of galaxy formation\u2013such as ongoing major and minor mergers, inflowing gas filaments, cooling gas flows, and feedback processes\u2013unraveling the cause and effect of physical processes proves a challenge. The PI will use numerical simulations to create \"Genetically Modified\" (GM) galaxies: simulations based on nearly identical initial conditions with slightly changed galaxy accretion histories. The controlled experiments of the GM technique  isolate the impact of different assembly histories, SMBH feedback implementation, and star formation histories to disentangle the complicated dynamical processes that drive galaxy formation.\r\n\r\nWorking with Community Colleges in Pasadena and the Cal Bridge Program,  the  PI will create and run a two-week, intensive coding summer school each year that includes teaching python coding skills, practical research experience with multiple forms of astrophysical data, and lectures on STEM-focused careers. The goal of this program is to increase the support for and retention of historically marginalized students in STEM-fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
