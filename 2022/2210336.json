This initiative focuses on establishing a statewide collaboration which will harness and realize the potential in the state for integrating AI into the design of accurate devices of diagnoses, smart surgeries, and precision rehabilitation. The proposed planning grant will be used to fund three meetings comprising a series of dialogues among ADAPT in SC participants and stakeholders. These meetings are anticipated to refine the ADAPT in SC team\u2019s understanding of the state of the art in fundamental AI science and its application in biomedical devices; the state of the art in education, training, and workforce development in the fields of AI and biomedical device design; and stakeholder perceptions of social, commercial, and economic factors affecting acceptance and adoption of AI techniques and AI-enabled devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
