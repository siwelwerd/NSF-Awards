 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a modern, ultrahigh resolution field-emission electron microscope (FE-SEM) at New Mexico State University (NMSU). The FE-SEM captures images from six detectors, simultaneously, with state-of-the-art resolution. The images from this instrument help researchers develop new materials that are crucial for next-generation designs of batteries, fuel cells and water purification membranes. The instrument will also allow researchers to look at components of cells, tissues, and soils to better understand the natural world and find new ways to improve our national health. This award supports high-level research and student training at three Hispanic-serving institutions in the southern borderland region. The presence of this instrument at NMSU will be a valuable tool for improving the education and academic success of students and faculty in this region of the United States. \r\n \r\nThe objective of this project is to acquire an ultrahigh resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) for research and education. Modern, ultrahigh resolution electron microscopy images provide critical information for researchers in both engineering and science fields and the acquisition of this equipment will accelerate current efforts. The initial user base includes faculty and projects that require FE-SEM for characterization of novel materials in fuel cell design, additive manufacturing systems, batteries, and membrane technology for clean water applications. Furthermore, application of modern FE-SEM instrument technology, sample preparation, and operation modes will enable profound, electron microscopy-based inquiry and scientific discovery in the biosciences. The acquisition of this equipment will facilitate discoveries that ultimately contribute to other fields, such as energy production, agriculture, aerospace, conservation, and medicine. The equipment offers important opportunities for the enhancement of university curriculum at three Hispanic-serving institutions, outreach to underserved communities in the region, and support of a diverse faculty research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
