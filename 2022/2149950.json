 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project focused on edge computing at Texas State University. This REU site provides opportunities for a cohort of 10 undergraduate students to gain summer research experiences for 10 weeks and to develop innovative edge computing technologies. Participating students are exposed to the principles, techniques, and challenges in a variety of aspects associated with edge computing. The site emphasizes the participation of a diverse group of students, in particular, women, minorities, first generation, and non-traditional students. The project includes workshops, student presentations and posters, field trips to local leading tech companies as well as research labs, and other professional development opportunities. The goal is to increase the retention of Computer Science (CS) students, instill the spirit of innovation in them, improve their career perspectives, engage them to participate in both fundamental and applied research in computing, and motivate them to enter graduate CS programs.\r\n\r\nIn this new era of data-driven and ubiquitous computing, edge computing is emerging and thriving to complement cloud computing by processing the data at or close to where it is generated. Edge computing is a key to efficiently and affordably realizing the growing internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) where tremendous data is generated at the edge of the networks by numerous sensors and end devices. This project will investigate and advance the state-of-the-art in edge computing from several perspectives, including real-time edge computing, wearable edge devices programming, high-performance edge computing, networks resource allocation at the edge, and edge time-series data labeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
