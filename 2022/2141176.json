 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to protect the integrity of electronic devices.  Counterfeit integrated circuits are a national security threat as they can appear in mission-critical systems, such as a nuclear submarine. The current supply chain has many potential weaknesses.  This project advances a technology to address counterfeits.  Inserting the proposed wireless identification circuit enables a semiconductor chip to be interrogated at any point in the supply chain where tracking is valued. This tracking can be validated by manufacturers, customs, and end users, leading to a real-time \u201ctrust but verify\u201d ecosystem that guarantees authenticity. \r\n\r\nThe project will demonstrate a complete embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) block, including a unique identification number to cryptographically generate a query response from a reader at a range of approximately 0.5 cm. It can be read in under 0.2 s with minimal sensitivity to alignment. The project goals include: (1) design of a suitable antenna, (2) incorporation of a Non-Volatile Memory to store the semiconductor chip\u2019s unique identification number, (3) removal of a voltage bias circuit, and (4) design and integration of a cryptographic identification communication system. The prototype will be built using validated circuit design techniques using a semiconductor foundry-provided design kit, fabricated into a demonstration semiconductor chip at an existing commercial foundry, and then assembled into a test and validation station.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\n\nThe envisioned product is a small RFID macro that can be embedded in high value chips (Figure 1) so that the usage history of the chip can be looked up in a blockchain secured database. Illegal chip recycling led to an estimated $7.5B total loss in 2011 (Senate report). Unique circuit IP demonstrated in background work resulted in an RFID circuit that is much smaller than conventional RFID circuits and is easy to re-implement in different semiconductor nodes. This dramatically reduces the cost of building the embedded RFID macro in comparison with the state of the art to less than 0.005c. Prior work resulted in a proof of principal demonstrator being built and successfully tested (figures 2 and 3). In this work we completed a redesign to enable a complete prototype to be built that included a cryptographically secured tag ID (preventing replay attacks, wherein the ID is copied) and redesigned cells for a 55 nm process. Unfortunately supply chain challenges due to COVID resulted in blocked fabrication access.\r\n\n\nThe concept of operations is that during wafer test a unique ID is written to each chip through a JTAG test interface. From that point forward the chip ID can be securely read through an RFID session. A centrally blockchain secured hyperledger fabric is used to the chip history, including disposal at end of life events (thus detecting illegal recycling). Central blockchain does not need expensive computation such as needed for distributely secured bitcoin.\r\n\n\nThe chip can also be used in traditional RFID applications, such as retail, though with reduced range.\r\n\n\nBroader Impact\r\n\n\nThis technology addresses an important and large market. We plan to fabricate and test a complete prototype as part of a new fabrication class. We are also working with a TEC (Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization) team in the Business school. With our commercial partner, we plan to explore a variety of commercialization paths once we have a prototype.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PaulDFranzon\n"
