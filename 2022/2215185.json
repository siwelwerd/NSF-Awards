 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. California State University-Sacramento (Sac State), is acquiring an instrument for size exclusion chromatography with multi- angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis, which will include an HPLC instrument with a UV detector and an autosampler for high throughput analysis, a refractive index (RI) detector, and a MALS detector to support the research of Professor Katherine McReynolds colleagues Linda Roberts and Stefan Paula. In brief, SEC-MALS is an absolute technique for determining molar mass and size of molecules in solution. The instrument involves the combination of size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering and offers an advanced characterization technique and overcomes the many limitations of column calibration. SEC-MALS is an extremely valuable and useful technique for the characterization of a wide variety of macromolecules, including synthetic polymers, lipids, proteins, and other biomaterials. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. The instrument will be used to trains a student population at the primarily undergraduate institution that is also classified as Hispanic serving and Asian American/Native American/Pacific Islander serving with a large portion of the student population identifying as being from underrepresented minority groups. The instrument gives students experience using vital instrumentation that they carry with them into their careers.\r\n\r\nThe award of this instrument that includes size exclusion chromatography with multi- angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts areas including chemistry, biochemistry and polymer science. Research is focused on the analysis of synthetic/biologic macromolecules and derive important structural information about these molecules. This work includes the study of the interactions between synthetic glycopolymers and various viral spike proteins (HIV and SARS-CoV-2) to better understand early-stage viral binding to host cells. The instrument will also enable the study of liposomes as models for prebiotic life forms, using the instrument to determine diameter and consistency of liposome preparations, as well as the examination of the abnormal oligomerization of apoA-I, which contributes to deposition of amyloid protein in arterial plaque.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
