 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricane Ida landed near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on August 29, 2021, as a Category 4 major hurricane. Ida was a deadly hurricane with devastating coastal storm surges and destructive winds. It brought heavy rainfall in Southern Louisiana and caused catastrophic flooding in many rural areas mainly Houma and LaPlace, LA. Such large-scale flooding has the potential to transport chemical agents and microbial pathogens and contaminate groundwater. Water wells in the region affected by flooding will be sampled, to assess groundwater quality. The goal of this study is to advance knowledge of the impact of extreme flooding on groundwater quality in coastal Louisiana following hurricane Ida. \r\n\r\nThe sampling campaign includes collecting 150 samples from groundwater wells, at 1, 3 and 6 months after Hurricane Ida. The study will leverage sampling prior to the event for comparison to post-hurricane data. This project is a time-sensitive and unique opportunity to collect perishable data and improve understanding of the extent of contamination in floodwaters from inland areas to groundwater. Specific objectives are to: (i) determine the source(s) of fecal pollution, heavy metals, and pathogen loads in floodwaters and groundwater post Hurricane Ida, ii) utilize 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize groundwater microbial community changes and iii) Map the spatial distribution of chemical and microbial contamination to identify households at risk of toxic contaminant exposure. The findings from this study will bring visibility the needs for protection and management of groundwater resources.  Information will be provided to well owners that can be used to develop guidance for protection of groundwater supplies after severe flooding. It will also aid in future research projects such as evaluation and development of small disinfection technologies for the control and treatment of contaminants in groundwater.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit\r\nand broader impacts review criteria.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
