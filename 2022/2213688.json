 "awd_abstract_narration": "With continued growth in the demands on wireless spectrum for wireless communication, spectrum policies are evolving at a pace far more rapid than ever before. Central to efforts of spectrum modernization is a critical need to accurately measure spectrum activities across diverse, wide bands and across wide areas in a cost-effective and accurate manner, so that impacts of such changes can be carefully evaluated and acted upon in a data-driven manner. The focus of this project, SpecScape, is to design, implement, deploy, and make available low-cost kits that allow spectrum sensing and measurement. In particular, the team is building an end-to-end infrastructure that includes mobile sensors to measure spectrum activity, a supporting software ecosystem, a cloud-hosted infrastructure to manage collected measurements, and mechanisms by which users can access such information.\r\n\r\nThe most significant broader impact of this project is that it provides a community-driven way to understand spectrum use across different spectrum bands -- across communications, astronomy, weather prediction, localization systems, etc. This information will aid researchers, industry practitioners, and governmental agencies, including policymakers. On the educational side, the team is involved in creating a hands-on wireless curriculum for undergraduates across multiple institutions (UW and UCSD), engaging undergraduates in research-related activities, and creating online courseware based on the spectrum sensing platform. The project also engages a broad audience through multiple dissemination channels of research outcomes and aims to encourage women and minority students to pursue STEM careers through opportunities in research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
