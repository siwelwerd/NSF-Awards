 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing safe, cost-effective elimination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater in order to protect human health and the environment while reducing the cost and complexity of remediation. PFAS are some of the world\u2019s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS pose a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. PFAS in groundwater cannot be broken down through traditional chemical processes; Hence, current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream where the efficacy and safety of disposal are still uncertain.  This project focuses on the development of a low cost, sustainable treatment method that eliminates PFAS with no secondary waste generation and no costly consumables.  This technology removes the liability and environmental and health risks associated with incomplete elimination and secondary waste disposal.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to develop a safe, chemical-free and low cost PFAS electrolyzer for groundwater remediation. The electrolyzer consists of a divided radial-field unit cell architecture with a de-polarized cathode and a high surface area and low-cost anode electrocatalyst material. The electrocatalyst is designed to provide direct oxidation at high voltage and the treatment process will mineralize PFAS in a single step, in minutes, with no breakdown byproducts or secondary waste. A scalable, single unit cell bench-top electrolyzer will be designed and built for treatability testing of PFAS-contaminated groundwater.  The anode electrocatalyst material composition will be optimized and coated onto high surface area substrates.  A de-polarized cathode will be developed to eliminate the catholyte loop and hydrogen generation, and lower energy consumption. The PFAS mineralization effectiveness will be measured as a function of operating parameters and water quality.  The electrocatalytic performance and the degradation mechanism of the new anode material will be determined. Using the experimental results, the capital and operating cost of a groundwater remediation system will be estimated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
