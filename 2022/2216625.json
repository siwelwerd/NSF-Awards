 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nAs of 2020, only 27% of Kansas high schools offered a computer science course. To address this dearth of access, The Cyber Pipeline Initiative led by the Kansas State University Department of Computer Science (KSUCS) provides computer science curriculum and teacher professional development, certification, and support across the state. Currently, the Cyber Pipeline reaches 7 schools. With this demonstration project, KSUCS aims to expand the Cyber Pipeline Initiative\u2019s coverage statewide. With 207 of the state\u2019s 286 school districts located in rural areas, the project will consider the unique challenges faced by rural students and their schools. In addition, the project will work to modify the Cyber Pipeline curriculum to be relevant to students with intersecting identities, including women, African American/ Black, and Hispanic/Latinx students in rural areas. The project will also increase understanding around how rural students engage with computer science and what strategies may attract more to the discipline. \r\n\r\nThe work will leverage the Cyber Pipeline Initiative\u2019s Computing Core Initiative (CCI) curriculum and instructional approaches to increase the number of students seeking and succeeding in CS by identifying and addressing immediate barriers faced by rural students. Over the two-year grant duration, at least 20 schools in Kansas will receive at least one Computing Core Initiative (CCI) course with associated instructor support to demonstrate that the use of CCI courses in rural high school settings leads to more women, Latinx, and Black/African American students entering pathways toward CS and computing-embedded degrees. Changes in students' attitudes toward learning CS, the effects of sharing information about local CS career pathways, the impact of offering one or more CS courses in high schools, and the degree to which students' social identities influence their interest in CS careers will be analyzed. To get a broader picture of the perceptions of computer science throughout the community this information will come from students, teachers, and parents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
