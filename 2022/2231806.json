 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this dissertation project is to understand how changes in resource densities and distribution across landscapes impacted subsistence strategies, mobility, and social connectivity of foraging communities. Researchers previously noted that large-scale environmental shifts impacted floral and faunal communities, which likely influenced human social organization by changing resource distributions and the distances between them. Coastal communities are particularly sensitive to such shifts, as environmental changes may submerge or expose large sections of land. An archaeological investigation can address such considerations as the extended timescales capture repeated restructuring of resource distribution and density. Within this broader context, this project  considers the impacts of coastal shifts on nutrient-rich resources, and asks whether foraging communities responded by expanding or contracting their social networks. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses larger questions about human response to changing resource distributions.  The doctoral student plans to use materials collected from coastal archaeological sites along a modern coastline and one in the hinterland, to better assess how forager subsistence strategies, mobility, and social connectivity were impacted across time and space. Previous research demonstrated that this area was subjected to multiple climatic events where the coastline expanded and contracted, offering a unique ability to situate these materials within a broader context. This project uses ostrich eggs to inform multiple dimensions of forager life: subsistence (eggs as food), technology (eggs as water containers), and social connections (flasks and beads as trade items). Investigators plan to analyze the eggshell surfaces, chemistry, and organic components, and present a model for using ostrich eggshell fragments more broadly to tackle questions of subsistence and mobility. By examining how foragers used ostrich eggs, a better understanding of responses to changes in resource distributions can be determined, as can an assessment of how this response changed over multiple climate cycles that had clear impacts on coastline resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This period of time covers several Ice Age cycles, during which global sea levels were lower than today and the coastline was far from the sites.

Our results on repeated campfire/hearth use of the eggshell demonstrate that repeated heating can produce an exaggerated effect on eggshell color, which changes according to temperature exposure. Repeated exposures at specific temperatures produce a color that is consistent with higher temperatures, while repeated exposures at other temperatures have no effect.

Increasing numbers of eggs were brought to site when the coastline was distant and coastal resources would have been harder to find.
