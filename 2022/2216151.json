 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The State University of New York - Buffalo is acquiring a diffractometer with a high brilliance microfocus Cu source and a hybrid photon counting detector to support the research of Professor Jason Benedict and colleagues Timothy Cook, David Lacy, Janet Morrow, and Mark Swihart. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, catalysis, and materials chemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. The reach of the instrumentation will include existing research and teaching programs at UB and some collaborative efforts with nearby institutions (D\u2019Youville College, Saint Bonaventure University, and Buffalo State College).\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. Research enabled by the instrument is focused on the study and characterization of a wide variety of substances including photoactive crystalline materials especially in metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and in pharmaceutical co-crystals, determining the structure of self-assembled co-facial porphyrin catalysts and photoactive metallocages, characterization of new MOFs containing antibiotic linkers and high entropy metal oxides prepared by flame-based aerosol reactors. Researchers will also explore the structures of paramagnetic transition metal complexes used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes, the structures of air sensitive organometallic catalysts, especially Mn and Ru complexes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
