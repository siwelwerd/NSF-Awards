 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ad\u00e9lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is the most abundant penguin in Antarctica, though its populations are currently facing threats from climate change, loss of sea ice habitat and food supplies.  In the Ross Sea region, the cold, dry environment has allowed preservation of Ad\u00e9lie penguin bones, feathers, eggshell and even mummified remains, at active and abandoned colonies that date from before the Last Glacial Maximum (more than 45,000 years ago) to the present. A warming period at 4,000-2,000 years ago, known as the penguin \u2018optimum\u2019, reduced sea ice extent and allowed this species to access and reproduce in the southern Ross Sea. This coastline likely will be reoccupied in the future as marine conditions change with current warming trends. This project will investigate ecological responses in diet and foraging behavior of the Ad\u00e9lie penguin using well-preserved bones and other tissues that date from before, during and after the penguin \u2018optimum\u2019. The Principal investigators will collect and analyze bones, feathers and eggshells from colonies in the Ross Sea to determine changes in population size and feeding locations over millennia.  Most of these colonies are associated with highly productive areas of open water surrounded by sea ice. Current warming trends are causing relatively rapid ecological responses by this species and some of the largest colonies in the Ross Sea are likely to be abandoned in the next 50 years from rising sea level. The recently established Ross Sea Marine Protected Area aims to protect Ad\u00e9lie penguins and their foraging grounds in this region from human impacts and knowledge on how this species has responded to climate change in the past will support this goal. This project benefits NSF\u2019s mission to expand fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes. In association with their research program, the Principal Investigators will create undergraduate opportunities for research-driven coursework, will design K-12 curriculum and assess the effectiveness of these activities. Two graduate students will be supported by this project to update and refine the curricula working with K-12 teachers. There is also training and partial support included for one doctorate, two master and eight undergraduate students. General public will be reached through social media and YouTube channel productions.\r\n\r\nA suite of three stable isotopes (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) will be analyzed in Adelie penguin bones and feathers from active and abandoned colonies to assess ecological shifts through time. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen (\u03b413C and \u03b415N) are commonly used to investigate animal migration, foraging locations and diet, especially in marine species that can travel over great distances.  Sulfur (\u03b434S) is not as commonly used but is increasingly being applied to refine and corroborate data obtained from carbon and nitrogen analyses. Collagen is one of the best tissues for these analyses as it is abundant in bone, preserves well, and can be easily extracted for analysis.  Using these three isotopes from collagen, ancient and modern penguin colonies will be investigated in the southern, central and northern Ross Sea to determine changes in populations and foraging locations over millennia.  Most of these colonies are associated with one of three polynyas in the Ross Sea. This study will be the first of its kind to apply multiple stable isotope analyses to investigate a living species of seabird over millennia in a region where it still exists today. Results from this project will also inform management on best practices for Adelie penguin conservation affected by climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
