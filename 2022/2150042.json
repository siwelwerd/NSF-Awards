 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE). It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. This REU project will introduce undergraduates to research methods in health equity fields that prioritize the involvement of community members. This includes approaches where community organizations or community members themselves may guide the focus of the research. This is in contrast to other methods where the research questions and methods are only determined by the researcher. These kinds of methods help to engage community members, which is especially important for addressing health equity topics. This is because health equity topics often focus on populations who have experienced exclusion and discrimination and may distrust researchers or the institutions they represent. It also ensures that the community members have a voice in determining what areas of health are of greatest need. We will introduce students to these methods by having them work on one of several ongoing or recently completed research projects that uses these kinds of methods. Students will complete analyses on the project of their choosing and be involved in other research activities to help them learn common methods for engaging and collaborating with community members. This work will be overseen by a mentor who led the original project. Undergraduate participants will also attend workshops that introduce them to a variety of key concepts for research that engages community members. Additional workshops will focus on professional development. At the end of these experiences, undergraduate participants will present their findings to researchers at the host university. Our approach to this kind of research helps ensure that undergraduates receive training on the best available methods for doing health equity research in a way that moves toward equity in outcomes. Because of the focus of the project, we also anticipate that our participants will be more diverse than the field as a whole. We therefore are likely to help advance the careers of a more diverse workforce to better address health equity research needs.\r\n\r\nThe health research workforce remains far less diverse than the communities they serve. Adequate representation is vital to advancing health equity within these fields. Prioritizing health equity and utilizing community-engaged approaches that respect the populations being studied provides the best opportunity for engaging the students who share these same backgrounds. Such approaches clearly communicate that their perspectives are valued and central to successful advancing this research. This summer REU will promote interest in advanced methodological approaches for health equity and health disparities related research. Faculty teach science through sequenced, weekly didactics leading to and operating alongside hands-on research across a 10-week summer program. This REU further facilitates cohort experiences in a laboratory setting, integrating REU students with project managers, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate research assistants for optimal learning and engagement. The goal of the project is to increase representation in health science careers by training participants in community-engaged methodological approaches to health equity research. Health equity is critical to overall public health and subsequently a central component of crosscutting initiatives within NSF, NIH, SAMSHA, and others. The continuation of this REU in health equity is critical for providing students diverse, applied research opportunities in health equity. It centers effective, yet underutilized methods like Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and culturally sensitive paradigms. This unique REU experience will continue to: 1) generate interest in health sciences, especially in health equity; 2) promote skill development for success in graduate education; 3) create a research support network to support students; 4) provide mentoring on career paths and graduate education, and 5) provide undergraduate students experience in presenting and publishing research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
