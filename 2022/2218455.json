 "awd_abstract_narration": "A changing climate will also create changes in the risks and opportunities faced by investors. If banks are exposed to the risks of climate change, then these risks could potentially affect how financial markets function.  This project will evaluate the exposure of banks and other financial institutions to climate change risks. After these methods are carefully tested for accuracy and reliability, the results will be updated weekly and posted freely on the internet for regulators, investors and policy makers to see. These estimates will help regulators assess financial system resilience in the event of climate related shocks. This project takes a completely new approach to stress testing for climate change. It focusses on prices of assets such as bank loans, rather than actual damages. Such bank stress tests can show exposure to climate change from damages that will not occur for more than twenty years but which could bankrupt a bank over a short period of time since asset prices can fall today in response to bad news about the distant future. These exposure measures are essentially a way to see how resilient banks are to climate related risks by examining the correlation between its stock return and climate risk factors. In fact, this observation leads to the measurement of the \u201cgreenness\u201d of any investment by looking at the correlation between its return and a suite of climate risk factors. \r\n \r\nThis project will apply state of the art statistical procedures to measure the exposure of financial institutions to climate risks. The procedure first formulates a portfolio of investment assets that reflects the risks of climate change. If climate change becomes more severe, this portfolio will fall in value.  Several candidates for this portfolio are based on transition risks or physical risks or other versions of climate risk. To assess the exposure of banks, the change in a bank\u2019s stock market valuation is regressed on the climate risk portfolios to see how important they are in determining the change in value of the bank. This regression allows the coefficients to change following the Dynamic Conditional Beta (DCB) framework as in Engle (2016). To be certain that this accurately measures the exposure, the project will a) develop the econometrics to estimate the confidence intervals in the dynamic conditional beta model, b) develop additional climate risk measures using climate efficient factor mimicking portfolios of publicly available funds marketed as sustainable, c) determine which portfolio is the best measure of transition risk, d) consider other risk factors for financial institutions, e) incorporate granular supervisory data to determine the extent to which market measures reflect actual bank holdings, f) compare the exposure rankings from the VRI model and from supervisory measures which mostly reflect NGFS methodology.  A key feature of this research involves the use of confidential supervisory data from central banks in different parts of the world. Together these unique data sources will help to corroborate and improve the estimates from the econometrics. Comparison of the findings with those from supervisors can be carried out simply by rank correlations. However more interesting comparisons may involve understanding where there are differences. For example, using one set of exposures to predict another and including characteristics data will show where the differences are most important.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The difference is the capital shortfall, or CRISK. We also compute marginal CRISK which is the difference between the capital shortfall today and the capital shortfall under climate stress.</p>\r\n<p>Although the most severe climate-risks are far in the future, asset prices today at least partly reflect their probability and impact. If a financial institution holds assets sensitive to these climate events, then rising assessments of the probabilities and impact can create substantial losses in a financial institution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The climate-related risks to the financial sector arise primarily from loans made to or other investments in exposed companies, although the liabilities of many financial firms &ndash; especially insurance &ndash; are also sensitive to these climate events. While physical risks may be dangerous, transition risks are more difficult to forecast and pose great disparities in costs and benefits. The benefits are spread over the whole world while the costs are borne most heavily by a small set of industries and companies. This effect is modeled by computing the climate beta of a financial institution corresponding to a portfolio of firms known to be highly exposed to climate transition risk, called a climate-risk portfolio. The beta is allowed to change over time using the DCB statistical model from Engle(2016).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRISK (like SRISK) is measured in dollars so it can be aggregated across institutions, indicating their collective exposure by country, region or globally. If the whole financial sector is exposed, then a rise in climate-risk can lead to a financial crisis with costs for the whole economy. CRISK for a country aggregates risk over the financial sector and provides a measure of systemic risk resulting from a rise in climate-risk. World CRISK also measures the global systemic risk.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Figure 1 is the daily climate beta for BNP Paribas over the last 10 years. When the beta is positive, it means that the stock value of BNP falls when the climate-risk portfolio return is negative.&nbsp; The beta can also be negative, if BNP&rsquo;s loan book includes companies that will do well when climate-risk rises.</p>\r\n<p>Figures 2-3 show marginal CRISK and CRISK for Barclays Bank. Even when marginal CRISK is low, the bank may need to raise capital if it is undercapitalized today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 shows the top 10 of 721 financial institutions in the Americas by CRISK. Clearly there are North and South American banks and insurance companies in the list. <br /><br />Figure 5 sums CRISK and marginal CRISK globally to give an aggregate measure of capital adequacy and climate exposure. These charts indicate that the capital shortfall of all global banks is now about $4 trillion but that the recent high exposure is only $2 trillion. The difference is particularly pronounced in China where the banks have been undercapitalized for years and climate-risk simply adds to the capital shortfall.<br /><br />In another related paper, Engle(2023) examines the implications of carrying out multiple stress tests. Should the investigator look only at the largest or the smallest risk or should he combine them in some way? In the case of CRISK, it is quite likely that banks may be exposed both to climate-risk and market risk (independent or correlated)? They are likely to be correlated as is shown in various recent work since high climate transition risk typically means high energy prices and possibly inflation which have a negative impact on the market. In VLAB, the C&amp;SRISK calculation allows users to specify the strength of both climate and market risk.<br /><br />Figure 6 shows the top 10 Asian financials&rsquo; C&amp;SRISK. The estimated capital shortfall for China Construction Bank is $351 billion and the total for China is $2.7 trillion.&nbsp;<br /><br />These measures are computed only for financial institutions that are listed and have stock market valuations. This is a serious drawback in some countries where institutions are government owned, are private&nbsp; or are subsidiaries of foreign banks. Engle and Jung(2023) and Manganelli et al(2024)&nbsp; have explored methods to compute SRISK (Capital shortfall due to market risk is called SRISK) and CRISK for unlisted financials. These models have now been estimated and will shortly be implemented in VLAB.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/03/2025<br>\nModified by: Robert&nbsp;Engle</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741021049435_Figure6--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741021049435_Figure6--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 6\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741021049435_Figure6--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 6\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top 10 Asian financials\ufffd C&SRISK</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VLAB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Engle\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 6</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020989978_Figure5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020989978_Figure5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020989978_Figure5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sum of CRISK and marginal CRISK globally</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VLAB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Engle\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020849131_Figure2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020849131_Figure2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020849131_Figure2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Marginal CRISK and CRISK for Barclays Bank</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VLAB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Engle\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020884352_Figure3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020884352_Figure3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020884352_Figure3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Marginal CRISK and CRISK for Barclays Bank</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VLAB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Engle\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020932831_Figure4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020932831_Figure4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020932831_Figure4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top 10 out of 721 financial institutions in the Americas by CRISK</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VLAB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Engle\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020807900_Figure1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020807900_Figure1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2218455/2218455_10812137_1741020807900_Figure1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Daily Climate Beta for BNP Paribas over the last 10 years</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VLAB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Engle\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
