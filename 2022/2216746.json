 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, automated co-design of machine learning (ML) models and accelerator architectures has attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia.  However, most co-design frameworks explore a limited search space. Furthermore, training the ML model and simulating the accelerator performance are computationally expensive. To address these limitations, this project proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) and hardware-accelerator co-design framework. It will consist of two new benchmarking sub-frameworks, CNNBench and AccelBench, that will explore vastly expanded design spaces of CNNs and CNN accelerators. CNNBench will use a new search technique to converge to the optimal CNN architecture. AccelBench will perform cycle-accurate simulations for a diverse set of accelerator architectures in a vast design space. Values for a large number of hyperparameters need to be chosen while designing an accelerator for a given application. They include the number and size of processing elements and on-chip buffers, dataflow, main memory size and type, and those for many domain-specific modules like sparsity-aware computation and reduced-precision designs.  Similarly, many hyperparameters come into play while designing a CNN as well: the number of layers, convolution type and size, normalization type, pooling type and size, structure of the final multi-layer perceptron head, activation function, training recipe, and many more.  At the same time, a CNN architecture that has the highest performance may not meet resource constraints like energy consumption and memory footprint. The proposed co-design framework will efficiently navigate the joint CNN-accelerator design space for the target application under given user constraints.  THe project expects at least an order of magnitude efficiency improvement in navigating this space relative to current baselines while delivering higher performance.  \r\n\r\nGiven the importance of the CNN-accelerator co-design problem to the industry, the proposed co-design framework will likely have a transformative impact on it.  To effectively transfer research results, the project plans to continue our active industrial engagements.  The project will recruit graduate/undergraduate female/minority students (the PI has supervised 15 female Ph.D. students so far as well as many female/minority undergraduate and high-school students). The project will ensure that the participants, including the broader public engaged through outreach, experience the interdisciplinary nature of the research. The research outcomes will be included in two undergraduate courses on Machine Learning and Embedded Computing. Outreach to high-school students is planned through Princeton Laboratory Learning Program.  Broad dissemination to the academic and industrial communities will be achieved through published papers, posters, and seminars. In addition, various tools and models will be distributed online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
