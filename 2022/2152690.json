 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a software platform for K-12 that helps to educate young and vulnerable students about cyber threats.  In addition, the proposed platform is designed to assist K-12 teachers to effectively communicate safe practices with students where the teachers do not have previous professional training in this area. This proposed tool for cyber security education also may provide value to a wide range of institutions within academia, industry, and government. Providing knowledge and training in a secure environment may increase the effectiveness of cybersecurity and digital fluency practices. By empowering and educating the next generation workforce, it may be possible to mitigate potential threats to businesses and institutions that are at risk of security breaches. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an education software platform that teaches cyber security awareness and protects against cyber threats aimed at K-12 students. One of the most prevalent of threats is identity theft, which affects millions of individuals annually, costing billions of dollars and emotional distress to the victims. Given the proliferation of social media, privacy education is essential to address the potential dangers facing the billions of people using these platforms. Because social media users span a wide range of demographics, there has been a lack of effective education methods and standards for increasing user awareness. The proposed technology uses a simple, cost-effective tool to teach cybersecurity and digital fluency practices regardless of user age and background. The technology is designed to provide value to all individuals with a social media presence, where account hacking or identity theft could have financial and/or social ramifications. The proposed initial target - the primary education system - may provide the greatest value to society as children are just entering the social media environment and are thought to be the most vulnerable and in need of privacy education. Early privacy awareness education may provide a solid foundation to successfully navigate current and future cybersecurity challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
