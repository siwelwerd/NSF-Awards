 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together research from interdisciplinary fields to create a novel approach to biology and biology education. This project draws from theoretical work across the humanities and even outside of the academy to change the way we think about knowledge about our living worlds. Currently biology education continues to rely on memorization of biological facts. Those facts are often simplified and narrowly developed in one discipline. By integrating knowledge from current science and technology literature into biology curriculum, undergraduate students will learn additional skills for engaging in science and research throughout their lives. The developed curriculum aims to shift how all people think about their competence and ethical responsibility to understand and fully participate in science. This study therefore has the potential to impact who becomes interested and invested in biology by using participatory ways of learning. This pedagogical intervention will contribute to the benefits of science to be more evenly distributed throughout society. The project outcomes will be of interest to policy makers, educators, parents and students. \r\n\r\nThe project is broken into three parts. The first part provides the basis and rationale for the project by analyzing current biology textbooks identifying points for intervention. Part two of the project culls research on the subject matter of biology, bodies and environments, from interdisciplinary academic and non-academic sources that are typically underrepresented in biology education. The final part of the project integrates these knowledges into education modules to be tested in classes and public forums. To realize its potential and allow for future expansion to K-12 and larger segments of the public, the results will be made broadly accessible to educators and laypersons through open access. This project may also serve as a model for how more interdisciplinary research can be successfully conducted across typical divisions between the humanities and sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Science and Technology Studies program in SBE and Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Program in EHR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
