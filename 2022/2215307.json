 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Missouri State University is acquiring a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LC/MS) to support the research of Professor Richard Biagioni and colleagues Laszlo Kovacs, Cyren Rico, Natasha DeVore, and Paul Durham. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of analytical chemistry, biochemistry, environmental chemistry, and biology.  Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. Students gain hands-on experience with the instrument in their research and learning in diverse fields including analytical chemistry, biochemistry, environmental chemistry, and biology.\r\n\r\nThe award of the LC/MS is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially of benefit to the scientific community in areas such as animal and plant metabolism; disease and treatments; and studies relevant to agriculture.  The instrument enables research focused on the metabolomics of plants exposed to pollutants, the analysis of flavonoids in grapes as a function of rootstock, the effects of grape seed extracts on trigeminal pain signaling, and dietary supplements as prebiotics to suppress migraine and TMD pain. It also assists in the study of metabolites related to orphan human CYP4X1and canine cytochrome P450, in elucidating the molecular basis of alpha-synuclein fibrillation and other amyloid proteins, and in the development of peptide- and peptidomimetic-based therapeutics that capture and neutralize melittin and histones. Other investigations include quantifying the presence of modified DNA bases that lead directly to deleterious effects within the cell, metalloporphyrins that contain lanthanide metal centers as novel ionophores, ultraviolet light exposure in calcium regulation of a benthic reptile, and the activity and reproductive patterns of the critically endangered Central American River Turtle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
