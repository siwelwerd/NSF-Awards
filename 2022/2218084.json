 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education, and sustainability of capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed STEM faculty.  This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic of 2020 caused major disruptions to institutions of higher education.  However, for tribal colleges and universities, whose core operating funds are directly aligned with student enrollment, drops in enrollment equate to loss of funding.  To mitigate against detrimental effects on STEM instructional capacity, this award will support the position of one full-time STEM faculty member, as well as other resources to maintain Little Priest Tribal College's STEM program as it recovers from the impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe RAPID: TCUP STEM Faculty Support achieved expanding the computer skills and knowledge of virtual teaching and learning for the science faculty.  The funding aided to increase capacity to offer effective online STEM courses, ensuring that students receive the best online learning experience possible.  The increasing of knowledge to virtual teaching and learning will continue as the technology changes and improves.\n\nIt is imperative for students to have faculty who can create a virtual lab conducive to learning.  A lab should have not only text but images and videos so students can read and visually see the experiment as it takes place.  This helps students\u2019 study and prepare to preform lab experiments in a face to face classroom. \n\nThe science faculty learning how to create video labs increases the knowledge of analyzing data for the students.  These labs may not be suitable for home creation of the student but still give the students\u2019 access to the experiment as if in a classroom environment. \n\nThe knowledge learned by the faculty helped to increase their skills of online teaching and learning making online learning easier for students but still understand how everything works together.  As stated, this is a continuous learning process for the faculty to continue learning and advancing their knowledge and skills to create content that is conducive to student learning.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brenda Conway"
