 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the effects of state-level population approaches both on school-level safety and educational outcomes and on student-level perceptions of school-level safety and educational outcomes are examined.  It is likely that healthy and safe schools are important for educational progress, success, and attainment.  As the United States becomes more demographically diverse, it becomes more important to understand how states\u2019 approaches to population may affect school safety and education and students\u2019 perceptions of school safety and education.  Results of this research are relevant to decision makers and stakeholders concerned with education.  This project is supported jointly by the Sociology Program and the Science of Broadening Participation Program.\r\n\r\nThis research will draw from multiple nationally representative datasets.  The National Conference of State Legislatures data will be used to assess change in state approaches to populations.  The different outcome variables will be taken from the School Survey on Crime, Safety; the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009; and Common Core Data.  Various statistical analyses will be employed to investigate the association between population approaches, school safety, education, and related student perceptions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
