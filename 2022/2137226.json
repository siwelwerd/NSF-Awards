 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant aims to establish an IUCRC Center on Data-driven High-rate Composites Manufacturing (DH-COM) at the University of Washington. The vision of the DH-COM center is to act as a vibrant innovation ecosystem of industry, academia and government agencies, establishing manufacturing of the future composites rooted in data-driven and advanced analytics methods, high-rate fabrication technologies, and advanced composite materials. The proposed center addresses an important challenge facing the US industries, especially in aerospace, automotive, defense and energy sectors - the increasing demand for lightweight and high-performance materials. Located in the Pacific Northwest, the proposed center is surrounded by and closely connected with national leaders in aerospace, composites, trucking and data science industries.  By developing data-driven high-rate composites manufacturing, the center  will support US global competitiveness by enabling: 1) lean and cost-effective manufacturing of complex composites with much less energy consumption, 2) composites to be used in applications that are currently done with other more costly and lower performance materials, 3) recyclable materials and products with much smaller environmental footprint, 4) fast development, testing and implementation of novel composites manufacturing processes, and 5) training and job opportunity for a diverse workforce with advanced composites science and technology knowledge that will become tomorrow\u2019s leaders in the composites sector.\r\n\r\nIncreasing demand for lightweight and high-performance materials is driving the global composites market to expand at a rapid speed. The primary objective of the proposed center is to address the currently unmet and underserved needs in composites manufacturing, especially those that limit the further expansion and adoption of various high-rate composites manufacturing technologies, and development of low-cost high-performance recyclable composites. Physics-based data-driven methods will be applied to all stages of composites manufacturing to develop an integrated technology from materials development, process control to performance prediction and health monitoring, as well as sustainability. Initial research will be conducted in several key areas including high-rate manufacturing, surface and interface science, physics-informed data-enabled closed-loop manufacturing, and cradle-to-cradle simulation. The proposed research will enable significant science discoveries and technology advancement, such as improved understanding of the complex material behavior under extreme conditions in the high-rate manufacturing processes; development and implementation of eco-friendly and recyclable  composites; novel multifunctional coatings with superior resistance against ultra-violet degradation, corrosion, and thermal fatigue; and in-situ monitoring/sensing, active-control and multiscale multi-physics simulation tools for understanding the effect of processing defects and service degradations on composites failure and performance of reprocessed materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The team conducted phone and video conference interviews as well as multiple on-site visits with more than 40 industry members spanning multiple sectors from materials suppliers, original equipment manufactures (OEMs), to end users in the space, energy and transportation industries. Based on the interview discoveries and to better align with industry needs, the DH-COM team re-organized/expanded the center research thrust areas, which now include: 1) high-rate manufacturing methods, 2) surface and interface science, 3) physics-informed data-connected closed loop manufacturing, 4) model-based engineering, and 5) sustainability. Also based on the industry discoveries, the center faculty put together a list of research projects with each project addressing at least two of the five thrust areas.

The planning meeting had over 100 registered participants including representatives from 28 different companies and University of Washington faculty, students and postdocs from five different engineering departments. During the meeting, the DH-COM leadership team presented the center vision, mission and research capabilities, which was further reinforced &nbsp;by three keynote presentations from industry and academic leaders. The center faculty presented 13 example research projects, and the students/postdocs presented 20 research posters highlighting some of the exciting and innovative research being conducted. The NSF director also presented on the IUCRC framework, providing valuable insights into how the center fits into the broader research landscape and effective models of industry-university collaboration. Throughout the meeting, the industry participants provided valuable feedback through the live Airtable feedback following each presentation, and an active industry workshop session provided further high-level discussions and feedback on the center strength, opportunities and challenges that DH-COM should look into. The workshop discussions and feedback served as a critical foundation for the center to further shape its research to align with industry needs and prepare for the submission the subsequent phase I proposal. The active interactions between the center faculty and industry participants at the planning meeting also led to many ongoing dialogue and partnerships between the center faculty and IAB members for both near and long-term collaborations, both within and outside of the DH-COM scope. Overall, the planning meeting was a huge success, paving the way for future collaboration and research initiatives in advancing the science and technology in data-driven high-rates composites manufacturing. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Junlan&nbsp;Wang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137226/2137226_10779146_1682820571290_DH-COMGroupPhoto_Sept142022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137226/2137226_10779146_1682820571290_DH-COMGroupPhoto_Sept142022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DH-COM Group Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137226/2137226_10779146_1682820571290_DH-COMGroupPhoto_Sept142022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DH-COM Group Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group Photo of DH-COM industry participants</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xiaopeng Bi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Junlan&nbsp;Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DH-COM Group Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
