 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education, and sustainability of capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed STEM faculty.  This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic of 2020 caused major disruptions to institutions of higher education.  However, for tribal colleges and universities, whose core operating funds are directly aligned with student enrollment, drops in enrollment equate to loss of funding.  To mitigate against detrimental effects on STEM instructional capacity, this award will support the position of one full-time STEM faculty member, as well as other resources to maintain Keweenaw Bay Ojibway Community College\u2019s STEM program as it recovers from the impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Final Report\n\nRAPID:  STEM Faculty Support to Address impacts from COVID-19 on Tribal Colleges and Universities Program Institutions\n\n \n\nGrant Number:  2214320\n\nGrant Dates:  March 1, 2022, to February 28, 2023\n\nGrant Amount:  $169,465\n\n \n\nPrinciple Investigator\n\nPaula Roth, Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College\n\n \n\nExecutive Summary for Public\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges were raised regarding online distance learning.  This included the quality of educational instruction, the student?s unequal access to essential technologies required for distance learning and the ability to use technology, not only for the students but also faculty.  This led to students becoming frustrated with the online distance learning platforms, ultimately leading to increased student failure rates, incompletes, and decreased enrollment numbers for our institution for the 2020 Fall semester.  We needed to reevaluate our science courses and reimagine innovative modes of learning that take advantage of the current technologies and improve upon technologies that we already utilized.  This would help to improve student outcomes and pass rates, but also increase interest and enrollment rates in our science programs and the institution. \n\n \n\nWe created changes in our science courses through implementing a new online curriculum, utilizing at-home lab kits, and having available an online laboratory application.  We hired a new adjunct science instructor who has valuable experience in teaching online science courses and knowledge of where to obtain other materials and resources the students may need.  We also purchased a new Learning Management System, Canvas, that will be implemented for the upcoming Fall 2023 semester.  We did find that with the implementation of the new curriculum, experienced adjunct instructor and at-home lab kits, student performance improved.  We offered two new science courses, and we increased enrollment in not only the science courses but the institution overall. \n\n \n\nMajor Goals\n\nWe had specific goals for this project.  The specific goals are as follows:\n\nImprove the current science curriculum.  \nDevelop and add additional science courses.  \nImprove delivery of online courses and access to online resources. \n\n\n \n\nAccomplishments \n\nFirst, we hired an adjunct science faculty that had experience and knowledge of how to teach science courses on the online platform.  This would not only help improve student outcomes but provide the on-site science faculty with a resource to help them improve their own delivery of the content.  It also provided us with someone who knew more about available resources available for virtual science learning and how we could incorporate them.  We hired an induvial who had been teaching online science courses for several years and she has been a huge asset in helping find resources, finding online applications, and improving the delivery of the science curriculum for each course We newly offered a Chemistry course in the Fall of 2022 and Microbiology which is currently being taught in the Spring 2023 semester.  She also took over teaching the General Biology course, making some needed changes to its curriculum. \n\nWe adopted at-home lab kits for all the science courses that we purchased through Carolina Biological Supply Company.  We utilized the project monies to purchase vouchers for the different kits identified by the adjunct instructor that would best supplement the course content.  These vouchers were available for this year?s students and will also be available for the upcoming school year. \n\nWith the addition of the two new science courses, we did see an increase in enrollment for the Microbiology course.  The General Biology and Chemistry course enrollment stayed steady with 4 students enrolled in each of these courses for the Summer and Fall 2022 semesters. The Microbiology course saw an increase in enrollment to 7 students.  This almost doubled our previous enrollment numbers for the science courses overall. \n\nNext, we researched Learning Management Systems and decided upon purchasing a license through Canvas.  This will not only make our LMS more user friendly for students and faculty but will also improve the delivery of online content.  While this will not be implemented institution wide until this upcoming Fall semester, our new science adjunct instructor is piloting it this Spring 2023 semester. \n\nWe also did some research into different digital resources that could be purchased and made available to our students through the library.  The monies from this grant made it possible to purchase a two-year license for Science Direct.  This will give the students access to the essential science resources needed to help them be successful in their science courses.  We also purchased books for the library related to Indigenous teaching of science and how they can be incorporated into the Western science curriculum.  As we are a Tribal Community College, it was important to find ways to bring cultural aspects of science into the classroom to show the differences and similarities.  It also helps the students, both native and non-native, to understand that science can be something other than formulas and theories.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paula Roth"
