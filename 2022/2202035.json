 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies\u2019 decadal surveys in space science have been widely praised for having a positive impact on federal agency planning and decision-making, in addition to promoting unity within the space science community. Decadal surveys are notable in their ability to sample thoroughly the research interest, aspirations, and needs of a scientific community. Through a rigorous process, a primary survey committee and thematic panels of community members construct a prioritized program of science goals and objectives and define a strategy that can achieve these objectives given anticipated budgetary and technical resources. As with past decadal surveys, the next solar and space physics decadal survey is designed to draw widespread community participation, engage the community in consensus-building, and set specific discipline-specific science targets and priorities for the coming decade. The study will provide scientific direction for the field of solar and space physics; organize the scientific community and the relevant agencies, particularly NASA, NSF, and NOAA; inform other decision-makers in the legislative and executive branches (particularly OMB and OSTP); document the needs for a scientifically- and technically-trained workforce in solar and space physics; and communicate the societal benefits of solar and space physics (e.g., interdisciplinary connections, education, workforce training, public outreach). The survey report will also contribute to the general public\u2019s greater understanding of recent accomplishments and future goals in solar and space physics. The new decadal survey will update and extend the 2013 decadal survey that resulted in the report, Solar and Space Physics, A Science for a Technological Society. \r\n\r\nThis project funds the Space Studies Board (SSB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to establish a decadal survey committee to develop a comprehensive science and mission strategy for solar and space physics (heliophysics) research for a ten-year period beginning in approximately 2024. The Survey Committee, numbering approximately 18 members and constituted according to Academy guidelines for expertise and diversity along a number of axes, will be responsible for the overall organization and execution of the study, as well as the production of a final consensus report that will undergo the usual National Academies review processes. The Committee will be informed in its work by up to six specialized study panels\u2014each with 12-14 members\u2014with allocation of the domain of study among them to be determined by the Survey Committee and the Space Studies Board. The proposed activity will be used by NSF and other federal agencies in formulating plans for future investments in solar and space physics-research and observational capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
