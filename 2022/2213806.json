 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award provides support for the Summer School for Integrated Computational Materials Education that is held on the campus of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Established in 2011, this summer school aims to expand the educational opportunities in computational materials science by training and assisting graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and professors who intend to incorporate computational and data science tools into university-level materials science and engineering education. The participants who complete the program become ambassadors of computational materials science and engineering - they return to their home universities/colleges and implement the modules and approaches presented in the summer school. This in turn stimulates the advancement of computational materials science, and thus will ripple through the broader field of materials science and engineering. Graduate student participants are trained in computational and data science approaches for both research and teaching, providing them the first step towards more in-depth learning of the computational techniques and future career path in higher education. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award provides support for the Summer School for Integrated Computational Materials Education. While computational approaches have transformed materials research, the education and training in materials science and engineering have not fully reflected the evolution of the field. In response to the needs and challenges identified by the community, this two-week summer school was established to \u201ceducate the educator\u201d by providing training through an intensive course on computational materials science and engineering (CMSE) and focus sessions on educational modules that can be adopted into existing materials science and engineering core courses. This program aims to equip current and future educators with abilities and materials to introduce CMSE to undergraduate students. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty who intend to incorporate computational and data science tools into university-level materials science and engineering education are invited to participate in the program. The modules that have been developed incorporate concepts from thermodynamics, kinetics, electronic properties, and mechanics. By training the educators, the Summer School benefits not only those who attend, but also the undergraduates who would be taught by the participants. It also provides a stepping-stone towards more intensive CMSE research training for researchers who are not necessarily familiar with computational approaches. This in turn broadens the application of computational and data science tools in materials research and development and thus stimulates the advance of computational materials science education, leading to ripple effects in the broader field of materials science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
