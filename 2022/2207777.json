 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical modeling of three-dimensional (3D) strongly correlated many-body systems such as superconductors is a fast-moving research frontier with immediate applications spanning areas from the development of novel materials to quantum state preparation. Classical computers - even fast supercomputers - cannot perform accurate simulations/studies of these systems due to the intrinsic complexity of the systems and the limitations of existing numerical techniques. This project will implement a 3D highly-programmable quantum simulator using a sodium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and experimentally demonstrate that this quantum simulator can be more powerful than its classical counterpart in studying such intricate many-body systems. BECs are ultra-cold gases in which atoms become essentially indistinguishable from one another, allowing for observations of quantum behaviors at a macroscopic level. Research goals of this project are both of fundamental interest for advancing our understanding on quantum physics and of technological significance. The principal investigator (PI) will integrate research and teaching by involving undergraduate and graduate students into research projects, and endeavor to broaden the participation of under-represented groups including Native American students and women in physics. The PI will also organize one-day workshops for local high school students to get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art quantum physics equipment and techniques. This project will encourage more students to pursue a career in science and technology. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis project will perform experimental studies on many-body systems in a 3D spinor Bose-Hubbard model quantum simulator consisting of an antiferromagnetic sodium spinor BEC confined in an optical lattice. Possessing spin degrees of freedom and exhibiting magnetic order and superfluidity, this quantum simulator is highly programmable with a remarkable degree of control over many parameters, such as temperature, spin, density, and dimensionality. The experimental studies include investigating out-of-equilibrium spin and spatial dynamics and non-exponential tunneling with spinor BECs in moving/driven lattices and achieving site-resolved spatial resolution via a quantum gas magnifier imaging technique to directly detect spatial distributions of 3D quantum systems and explore previously inaccessible microscopic regimes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
