 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every discipline from transportation to policing to healthcare. Yet, AI-based systems often make mistakes when facing scenarios that they have never seen before. For instance, one of the most critical issues with autonomous, self-driving cars is the inability to handle edge cases, causing accidents both with and without humans behind the steering wheel. The goals of this research are to build AI-based systems that harness external sources of knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia) to make more informed and thus more accurate decisions. In addition, the AI systems have a transparent decision-making process that human users can leverage to make accurate decisions or debug AI systems. With these goals in mind, the project will address three research questions on making AI-based systems. First, the system should be designed for addressing robust to new, edge cases in the complex, evolving real world. Second, the AI system should maximize user accuracy when humans are the end decision-makers. Finally,  systems should be built so human users can debug and understand the systems\u2019 decision-making process. Education and outreach activities of the project include a new Explainable AI course in Auburn University, an AI club in K-6 school, and collaboration with industry.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the challenges in image classification frameworks that harness explicit visual and textual knowledge from external knowledgebases to make decisions. Towards this, the researchers will utilize large text corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) and image datasets as an external source of information for image classifiers to leverage (for instance, by comparing the input image with support images) and make better decisions. The research goal is to shift the paradigm of image classifiers from the existing parametric approach that relies only on an input image for the deep neural networks (DNNs) into a hybrid, semi-parametric, system that uses DNNs to process the input image but also iteratively searches in an image-text database. This paradigm shift will help improve the accuracy of decision-making for both the AI-based systems and human-AI teams. The information-retrieval-based approach to computer vision will make the decision-making process of AI-based systems: (a) be more robust to ill-posed image classification cases e.g., under occlusions; (b) inherently more understandable to users as humans can naturally interpret the support images or text retrieved by the systems; (c) it could also lead to more robust DNNs for image classification tasks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
