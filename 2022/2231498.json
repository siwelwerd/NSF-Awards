 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Structural Bioinformatics Workshop (CSBW) is a single-track, one-day workshop featuring peer-reviewed works on advances in computational methods in structural biology. Understanding the fundamental role of protein and nucleotide structures in life processes involves many computational challenges. It is held as part of the IEEE-Bioinformatics and Biomedicine. New experimental and computational techniques that generate and use large amounts of structural data have enabled novel analysis approaches, leading to an increased understanding of different biophysical phenomena. CSBW provides a forum for discussion of the newest computational approaches related to protein structure discovery and analysis. Structural biology is an interdisciplinary field, and CSBW connects scientists who work on this topic through the lens of various academic areas, such as computer science, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and computational biology. One of the main goals of the proposed workshop is to connect undergraduate and graduate students to the  computational bioinformatics community, giving them an opportunity to present their work to top scientists in  the field and to network with their peers. Such interactions have a lasting impact in a student\u2019s academic life, as they expose students to state-of-the-art research and creates the professional connections needed for career advancement.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will bring together senior researchers and students working on exploring the relationships between sequence, structure and protein function via computational structural bioinformatics. The workshop will showcase the newest developments on a diverse set of problems and computational methods, including: Structure representation, prediction, and alignment, biomolecular interaction and docking, molecular dynamics simulations, biomolecular graphics, coarse-grained modeling, data mining of structural data, structural genomics, optimization in structural problems, high-performance computing in modeling, graph theory applied to structural problems, and biomolecular structure refinement. The participation of researchers from diverse backgrounds will advance understanding of common scientific themes and may facilitate collaborations around shared research goals. Papers accepted to the workshop will be published in IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Workshop participants will also receive invitations for a special issue in a peer-reviewed journal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe field of Computational Structural Bioinformatics has seen rapid advancements in recent years, reflecting the growing importance of computational methods in understanding biological structures and processes. Recognizing this,\nwe co-organized a full-day workshop that brought together leading researchers, scholars, and students to share their latest findings and foster collaborations. The workshop, which was the first in-person after the pandemic, was held from 8:30 am to 6:20 pm, marking a significant milestone to the gradual return to normalcy.\nIntellectual Merit Outcomes: A highlight of the workshop was the announcement of invitations for submission to the International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS) special issue titled \"Recent Advances in Computational Structural Bioinformatics\". Four papers have seen been published and these papers, selected from a competitive pool of submissions, showcased new research and innovations in the field. The publication of these papers in a special issue of IJMS provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. The workshop featured a rich program of presentations, with 15 papers accepted from over 30 submissions. We conducted a rigorous peer-review process and presented a high caliber of research conducted by the participants. The presentations covered a wide range of topics, demonstrating the diversity and depth of computational structural bioinformatics. A keynote speech by Ron Dror, a renowned figure in the field, was a highlight of the event. His insights and perspectives sparked lively discussions and new ideas.\n\n\nBroader Impact Outcomes: In our commitment to supporting the next generation of researchers, the award managed by UAlbany NY sponsored six students to attend the conference. These scholarships, with a maximum award of $1250, were instrumental in enabling students to participate in this impor-\ntant academic event, providing them with an opportunity to learn from and interact with leading experts in the field. The workshop offered various opportunities for networking, making it a pivotal event for researchers, scholars, and\nstudents alike. As the first in-person workshop since the pandemic, it provided a much-needed platform for attendees to reconnect with colleagues, meet new collaborators, and engage in meaningful conversations. These interactions are\ncrucial for sparking collaborations, sharing insights, and advancing research in computational structural bioinformatics. Following the success of the workshop, it was extended to the ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Bi-\nology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB), further amplifying its impact on the field. This extension provided an additional avenue for disseminating the insights and outcomes of the workshop to a broader audience, enriching the ACM-BCB conference program and fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations. The workshop was designed to maximize engagement and learning opportunities for all attendees. The full-day schedule was packed with high-quality presentations, discussions, and networking breaks. We develop the workshop website for dissemination http://cs.wwu.edu/csbw which serves as a valuable hub of information. The workshop was a resounding success, marking a significant milestone in the fields advancement. The combination of high-quality research presentations, the publication of selected papers in a special issue of IJMS, and the opportunities for networking and student involvement made this event a cornerstone for future developments in computational structural bioinformatics. As we look forward to future events and collaborations, the outcomes of this workshop will undoubtedly continue to influence and inspire the field into the future. \n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChinweEkenna\n"
