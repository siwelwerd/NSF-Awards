 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). This award is for renewed funding of the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, who will perform state-of-the-art data analysis using a wide variety of space- and ground-based astronomical observations. The student projects include the general areas of: formation and evolution of stars, groups and clusters of galaxies, large-scale structure of the universe, cosmology, and star clusters.\r\n\r\nThe MMO REU program will have a significant impact on the skills and career development of student participants by enhancing their capability to do research, to present their results at scientific meetings and in public settings, to write scientific papers, and to write observing proposals to use national and international telescope facilities. Hundreds of undergraduate students have participated in the REU program to date, the great majority of them women, and many have gone on to successful careers as astronomers at leading universities, observatories, and other organizations around the world. Indeed, roughly one of every 20 American women with a PhD in astronomy today acquired formative research experience at the MMO. This award will therefore contribute to developing a talented STEM workforce in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Today, the MMA is a recognized leader in training the next generation of astronomers. The success of this pioneering program was recognized in 2009 with the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring from President Obama. Hundreds of undergraduate students have participated to date, the great majority of them women, and many have gone on to successful careers as astronomers at leading universities, observatories, and other organizations around the world.

Fully 67% (8/12) of the students supported on this award are women, while 83% (10/12) are members of traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. 50% (6/12) of the students hail from small, liberal arts, and undergraduate-only universities, where access to astrophysics research is limited or non-existent.</p>\n<p>Keenly aware of the importance of cultivating diverse mentors, ~90% (8/9) of the affiliated astronomer mentors active during this award are women. Of those, one woman is an alumna of the MMA REU program, providing not only first-hand testaments to the long-term career successes of MMA REU alumnae, but also, real-world mentoring and networking for current MMA REU students. Finally, it should be noted that the current Director of the Maria Mitchell Observatory is a woman and also an alumna of the MMA REU program.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong></p>\n<p>Research at MMO emphasizes state-of-the-art data reduction techniques and thoughtful physical interpretation. Data for projects come from leading ground- and space-based observatories as well as next generation surveys and cosmological simulations. Students also obtain data with the MMO's 24- and 17- inch research telescopes equipped with modern CCD and CMOS cameras. Each MMO REU student works on an individualized research project under the guidance of experienced astronomers, as well as a collaborative team project.

Throughout the summer students participate in weekly group meetings to discuss their research progress, weekly professional development activities, and lectures from visiting astronomers.</p>\n<p>MMO REU students disseminate results of their research at the annual winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) where 100% (12/12) of the students prepared and presented either a poster or talk. During this award period, one MMO REU student won the prestigious Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award to recognize exemplary research. Students presented at multiple other scientific conferences and at their home institutions, as well as publishing papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals. During this award period, MMO REU students have published one first-author peer-reviewed paper and one co-authored peer-reviewed paper, and several additional papers are currently in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journals.</p>\n<p>Students also develop their communication skills by participating actively in public outreach, especially our twice-weekly public stargazing open nights at the observatory, a very successful outreach program that attracts more than 4,000 visitors each summer.

Extensive follow-up shows that their REU experience at the MMA crucially influences the career choices of many students.

Of the current award period, 75% (9/12) of the students are now enrolled in graduate programs, while the remaining 3/12 have not yet completed undergraduate studies. The long-term mentoring and advising of each MMO REU student is continued well after their summer research experience is over and each student becomes part of the MMA 'family,' supported by the Director and an online community of alumni and affiliated astronomers. MMA REU alumni reunion events, such as the annual alumni breakfast at the AAS meeting, nurture students' professional growth and provide further networking opportunities.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
