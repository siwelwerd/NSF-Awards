 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a conference proposal to help participants attend the Snowmass Community Study meetings 17-26 July in Seattle. The participants will be mainly from early career members and students.\r\n \r\nThe Snowmass Community Study is a field wide effort. Attendance at the final summer meeting\r\nwill be important for building consensus in the community. Each frontier will be discussing the major challenges it faces and its vision for the next decade. Early career members of the community have traditionally been underrepresented in the Snowmass conversation, despite being the most likely to be part of the community in the coming decades. The funds requested in this proposal will make it easier for younger members of the community to be a part of this conversation.\r\nThe Particle Physics Community Planning Exercise (a.k.a. \u201cSnowmass\u201d). Snowmass is a scientific study. It provides\r\nan opportunity for the entire particle physics community to come together to identify and document a\r\nscientific vision for the future of particle physics in the U.S. Snowmass will define the most important\r\nquestions for the field of particle physics and identify promising opportunities to address them.\r\nThe Snowmass Community Study has 10 frontiers addressing different aspects of the field. They\r\nare: Energy Frontier, Neutrino Physics Frontier, Rare Processes and Precision Measurements Frontier,\r\nCosmic Frontier, Theory Frontier, Accelerator Frontier, Instrumentation Frontier, Computational\r\nFrontier, Underground Facilities, Community Engagement, and the Snowmass Early Career Scientists.\r\nAt the summer study the frontiers will agree on their final, individual, reports. The frontiers conveners,\r\nalong with the US High Energy Physics community, will draft a final summary document that presents\r\nthe big questions facing the field and science of particle physics along with research paths forward.\r\nThe Snowmass Report will provide input to the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel. The Particle\r\nPhysics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), a sub-panel of HEPAP, will produce a strategic report for\r\nthe field later in 2022.\r\n\r\nThis award will help fund participation of underrepresented groups by selecting:\r\n\u2022 Early Career members who do not have other funding for the conference.\r\n\u2022 Applicants who are actively involved in the Snowmass process\r\n\u2022 Applicants who are presenting at the conference (talk or poster)\r\n\u2022 Members of underrepresented groups (women and underrepresented minorities)\r\nThis broader participation will  help shape the future of High Energy Physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
