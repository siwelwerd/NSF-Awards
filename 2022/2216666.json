 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fire is an inextricable part of human history, and its use has resulted in pivotal technological, cultural, and biological changes that shaped frameworks of human experience across time and space. However, the relationships between human biology, culture, and the byproducts of fire use \u2013 specifically those in smoke \u2013 have remained critically understudied. This is particularly the case during the time of the agricultural transition, when new cultural choices in architectural design, fuel consumption, and division of labor exposed human populations to high levels of indoor air pollution. It is a problem that has persisted through time and still affects many populations throughout the world today. This doctoral dissertation research project uses an experimental approach to address how exposure to indoor air pollution shapes the mineral and protein components of bone, and in so doing offers a new opportunity to understand how indoor air pollution shapes bone health and to identify pulmonary disease in skeletal remains independent of other evidence that might not always preserve, such as soft tissue or DNA. The results of this study will inform a new perspective regarding the development of human fire-related technologies and associated health repercussions. This project trains undergraduate students in laboratory techniques and science outreach within their local communities and help in disseminating the findings of the project with the public at large. \r\n\r\nChronic exposure to indoor air pollution damages lung tissue and perturbs microbial communities throughout the body. The core methodological approach of this project employs a combination of isotope analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA genetic data. Oxygen isotopes are used to assess how damaged lung alveoli shape oxygen isotope fractionation and contribute to the body water pool from which bone phosphate forms. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes, together with 16S ribosomal RNA data, are used to investigate how changes in the oral and gut microbiomes and host-associated immune response shape the isotopic composition of bone collagen. Results from this project elucidate the effects of indoor air pollution on the skeleton and provide a tool with which this and future projects can investigate the health repercussions of indoor air pollution across time and space.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
