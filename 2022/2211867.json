 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the behavioral drivers and real-time changes in behavior affecting the potential transmission of the Omicron variant off the SARS-COV-2 respiratory virus during critical moments of crowding, mingling, and interacting in close quarters. It aims specifically to understand the social complexities of ritual and travel that reduce or heighten the risk of COVID-19 infection. Data from the study contributes intellectually to high-priority biomedical research that seeks to advance public health interventions. This study will provide critical information for the development of public health programs and guidelines that address the risks communities face with the Omicron variant. The project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis study tests existing theoretical presumptions that people disregard state-mandated health regulations at moments when cultural, religious, and social rites of solidarity and obligations take priority. The emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant during a peak travel season provides an opportunity to map transmission pathways in real time. This project triangulates ephemeral data regarding holiday travel and religious ceremonies with social network information and household demographics. Data from behavioral observations of religious ceremonies will yield information about social practices compared with state-mandated regulations of masking, vaccinating, and social distancing. Data regarding social networks will yield information about linked urban-rural migrant pathways for potential disease transmission. Data from interviews will record age, ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, marital status, family size, and will aid in mapping migratory patterns and social networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
