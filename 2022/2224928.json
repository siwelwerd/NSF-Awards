 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Quantum Technologies (CQT) is a partnership between Purdue University, Indiana University (Bloomington and Indiana University Purdue University - Indianapolis Campuses), and the University of Notre Dame. The mission of the CQT is to collaborate with industry and government stakeholders to identify compelling needs and challenges in quantum technologies, and then develop novel solutions to address these opportunities. Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the four universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThe overarching vision of the CQT is to bring together multidisciplinary experts in academia, industry, and government in a self-sustaining, collaborative venture facilitating the transition of fundamental research discoveries in quantum science and engineering into novel, commercial-ready technologies. Specifically, CQT will focus on three significant industrial and government interests: quantum computing (including simulation and algorithm development), quantum sensing, and quantum communications. This includes: Algorithmic development for general purpose quantum computers, Quantum programming abstractions and optimizations, Quantum error mitigations and corrections, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) and hybrid quantum-classical platforms for materials and chemical design, Quantum-enhanced sensors for gravimeters, Microchips for scalable and electrically controlled single photons, and Fiber photonics for quantum interconnects and repeaters. Due to the wide applicability of quantum technologies, the relevant industry base is broad. The technologies developed in the CQT may save energy, speed up computation, enhance national security and defense, and innovate health care. Indiana University (IU) houses several unique facilities, including the IU Center for the Exploration of Energy and Matter, a national resource for the design and construction of large-scale equipment for use in nuclear, particle, accelerator, and materials experiments. IU also has facilities for cold atom and ion-trap state-of-the-art Laboratories; the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Science Hall for machine and instrument making, electronic, vacuum, detector, and cryogenic technologies as well as fibers and additive manufacturing-enabled systems, with draw and additive manufacturing facilities, fiber preform fabrication and optical/electronic characterization laboratories. The Nanoscale Characterization Facility and the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute, which host many instruments for material processing and characterization are also available to researchers in CQT. IU investments in QIS, featuring one of the country's first quantum engineering programs and an intensive one-year, multi-disciplinary Masters degree.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
