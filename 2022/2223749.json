 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nThe Steering Committee of the Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC) will host a conference meeting from August 25th to 28th in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of biomedical science and engineering. This conference strongly supports and promotes the research engagement of students, especially ones who are not well-funded, under-represented, or otherwise not likely to be able to attend conferences. The mission of the conference is to encourage students to pursue cutting-edge research in the field. NSF funding will be used exclusively to support conference registration fees and their other related costs (e.g., logistics and travel, etc.) for URM researchers. Eight to ten underrepresented minority (URM) students from multiple universities will be supported to attend this conference. These students will present papers and posters at the conference, and their abstracts will be published in the yearly issue of SBEC proceedings.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThis award will increase the participation from underrepresented minority (URM) communities at the 38th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (New Orleans, LA; August 25-28, 2022). The goals of this conference include exchanging knowledge while gaining a better perspective on the advances in the field of biomedical science and engineering, and discussing the issues faced by clinicians and researchers. Several topics including biomaterials and their applications in implants, tissue engineering, drug delivery etc., presented at this conference will help researchers, engineers, and clinicians find balance between innovative technology and the human side of medical care. In keeping with the emphasis on student participation, the SBEC will provide best paper and presentation awards to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Student testimonials will be collected to assess and summarize the impact of attending this conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
