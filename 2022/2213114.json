 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept of using an innovative open aquatic algae cultivation system (OAACS) to overcome scale and cost constraints of current large-scale algal biomass production systems like raceway ponds. Drop-in biofuels derived from OAACS\u2019 biomass have a projected minimum fuel selling price of $2.53/gasoline gallon equivalent, which is competitive with fossil fuels, and have potential production scales that exceed current global fossil fuel usage. Successful commercialization of OAACS can lead to new sustainable energy sources, significant displacement of fossil fuel use, and concomitant reductions in the future environmental and societal impacts of global climate change. If successful, OAACS can also pave the way for sustainable, competitive, and meaningfully large-scale production of other bioproducts like fertilizers and high protein feeds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to fabricate robust liners for OAACS using an innovative forced assembly co-extrusion and two-dimensional multiplication technique and then demonstrate their performance in OAACS scale-down laboratory photobioreactors. The minimum success criterion is production of liners that support sustained algal aerial yields >15 g ash free dry weight/m2/day for weeks or months without the need for liner cleaning or CO2 supplementation. This will establish feasibility that OAACS can meet production scale- and cost-targets. Tasks include: 1. Fabrication and physical characterization of base case liners using previously demonstrated techniques and then extending results to liners with pore size gradients and surface modified nanofibers; 2. Demonstrating high dissolved inorganic carbon transfer rates through the liners; and 3. Demonstrating robust performance of the liners during continuous culturing in laboratory photobioreactors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
