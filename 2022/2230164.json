 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the 3-day workshop \"Trends in Soliton Dynamics and Singularity Formation for Nonlinear Dispersive PDEs\" to be held on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, on October 21-23, 2022. The topic of the workshop lies at the forefront of research on nonlinear wave equations. Wave equations are at the heart of a wide range of natural phenomena, including electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and particle physics. As such, the rigorous mathematical analysis of these equations is fundamental in obtaining a deeper understanding of the world we live in. This workshop aims to bring together leading international experts and junior researchers, providing an opportunity for the younger generation to interact with leaders of the field and to learn about cutting edge mathematical developments. Junior researchers also can present their research in the form of contributed talks. The workshop is structured to create many opportunities for discussions and to foster an environment for collaboration and for the exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical focus of the workshop is on recent developments in the study of soliton dynamics and singularity formation for nonlinear dispersive PDEs, and on the interplay with developments in related areas. In the context of this workshop, solitons refer, roughly speaking, to solutions to partial differential equations that exhibit some form of coherent structure. It is expected that they play an essential role for the overall dynamics. This is an active and fast developing branch of research, where recent ideas and techniques are finding applications in many other areas. The PIs hope this workshop will provide an opportunity for all participants to learn about the fascinating new developments in this area, to form new collaborations, and to explore interesting connections to other areas. Funds will be used for the accommodation and travel costs for junior participants. More information about the workshop and its goals can be found on the website: https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/solitons-workshop-tamu/about\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
