 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design and research a professional development (PD) model in which elementary teachers experience integrated, place-based, culturally sustaining STEM curriculum focused on local watersheds and grounded in local Native American cultural values and knowledge. The teachers will then design and implement their own culturally relevant STEM unit, guided by the PD, which is situated within their local watershed and Indigenous community. Few studies have examined the impact of PD that focuses specifically on such approaches on teachers\u2019 self-efficacy in culturally relevant STEM or, further, on the impact STEM curriculum that embeds Native American values and knowledge has on student engagement and interest. The PD is designed for teachers across a range of school settings and cultural contexts in North Dakota with materials developed for their communities\u2019 unique regions and cultures. North Dakota is home to diverse Indigenous communities, with five federally recognized tribes. The PD will include promising, but often isolated, elements of prior PD models to give teachers: a) culturally relevant pedagogy inclusive of Indigenous students, b) pedagogical content knowledge, c) a supportive professional learning community, d) place-based watershed curriculum, e) and structured time for teachers to collaborate on creating units for implementation. The project will disseminate findings to local and state school communities, the greater public, and the STEM education community via presentations and peer-reviewed publications. The project model will be shared more broadly with educators so that it may be widely used, including adapting elements of PD and integrating it in pre-service teacher methods coursework. \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of this PD approach and its impact on students will be evaluated by exploring the following research questions: (1) How do teachers engage with STEM professional learning experiences that immerse them in the cultures of the Native American communities in North Dakota? (2) What is the impact of PD that integrates culturally relevant pedagogy and local Indigenous community connections on teachers\u2019 culturally relevant STEM self-efficacy? (3) How do teachers integrate culturally relevant approaches and adapt them to effectively link to NGSS introduced in the PD? and (4) How does culturally responsive, place-based curriculum impact students\u2019 attitudes, interest, and engagement with STEM? A flexible, mixed-methods research design using quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis will be used to explore teacher perceptions, experiences, changes in self-efficacy and changes in teacher practice as well as student responses and outcomes. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
