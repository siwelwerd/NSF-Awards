 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to eliminate more than 95% of particulate emissions (i.e., carbon soot) from diesel exhaust while reducing fuel usage, carbon dioxide production, and vehicle maintenance.  Diesel particulate pollutants are directly related to respiratory and heart disease.  Curently this is addressed with diesel particulate filters (DPF), devices that trap particulates and do not destroy them. Furthermore DPFs are prone to clogging, resulting in wasted fuel and costly engine maintenance. This project advances a non-thermal plasma (NTP) solution to destroy diesel particulates by converting them into non-hazardous compounds. NTP technology also has potential to be applied more broadly to power plant smoke stacks and other sources of particulate emissions.  The proposed solution will develop a NTP device for retrofitting diesel fleets, such as buses, waste haulers and utility trucks, improving engine performance and reducing operating costs. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project researches novel materials and components for use in a non-thermal plasma (NTP) reactor capable of withstanding the harsh conditions within the main exhaust stream of a diesel engine (e.g., 650 C temperatures and high exhaust flow). First generation NTP reactors capable of operating in low-temperature exhaust (e.g., 150 C) have already been developed and sold for use in diesel exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems; however, only about 30% to 50% of total diesel exhaust flows through EGR. The objective of this research is to demonstrate feasibility of NTP technology for use in the main exhaust stream to treat 100% of particulate emissions. The research plan will accurately characterize the working environment of the main diesel exhaust system and identify potential designs and parts/materials, creating hybrid or completely new components. Promising candidate components will be assembled into a prototype reactor and evaluated on an accelerated schedule to measure performance representing 6 months of typical operation. The system will be optimized for thermal, chemical, electrical, and mechanical performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
