 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the scientific activities at the Aspen Center for Physics (ACP), one of the premier theoretical physics research institutions in the world. The ACP is unique in its combination of programs of high scientific quality coupled with an extraordinarily fertile collaborative research environment. Each year, from late May to mid-September, the ACP attracts about 500 of the world's leading physicists to Aspen where, participating in multiple-week workshops, working groups, or individual research projects, they interact, discuss, collaborate, and challenge each other while sharing ideas at the forefront of their disciplines. The ACP also organizes between five and eight one-week Winter Conferences, bringing together as many as 100 researchers each week to respond to rapidly breaking developments in areas of current interest in physics and interdisciplinary research. As a result of this intense activity, each year several hundred journal articles, book chapters and scientific manuscripts explicitly acknowledge the ACP for the birth of new ideas, for the formation and nurturing of collaborations, for the opportunity to concentrate on advancing or completing work, and for essential ingredients contributed by fellow researchers to overcome roadblocks to progress. Thus, funding for the ACP advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science across a variety of subdisciplines of physics.\r\n\r\nIn both summer and winter, participating physicists also contribute to a rich and visible science outreach program. Each winter conference features a free public lecture, preceded by a \"Physics Caf\u00e9\" in which two to three conference participants engage with an audience of 50 to 100. Each summer, ten to twelve free public talks are held on the ACP campus, with typical attendance close to 100. All public lectures and talks are recorded and made available on the ACP web site. Weekly \"Physics is for Kids\" summer barbeques feature hands-on activities and an interactive demonstration/talk by an ACP participant. Also in the summer, top physics students from local high schools work at the ACP for a week each and meet one-on-one with physicists to discuss STEM interests and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
