 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by promoting student success in an introductory college physics course. This project plans to implement and compare three different active learning formats in physics teaching. All three formats are based on proven best practices known to improve student success. However, each format differs in how it incorporates team dynamics and student leadership in the classroom. Each format also differs in cost. By comparing student outcomes in the three formats, this project hopes to address how the incorporation of student leadership and teamwork could cost-effectively improve student success and learning in college physics class. This could advance knowledge about building a diverse and inclusive workforce, as well as broadening participation in STEM. The project has the potential significance of creating a low-cost model that can be implemented in undergraduate STEM classrooms broadly to promote student success and retention, while also developing students\u2019 leadership capacity and teamwork skills, both highly valued workplace skills. \r\n \r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate three active learning classroom formats in the context of introductory college physics. The project will compare three active learning formats, all of which vary in cost and use different active learning, student leadership, and teamwork elements. The three formats will be implemented in parallel over the course of four semesters and are distinguished by having: (a) no undergraduate student learning assistants in leadership roles, (b) paid undergraduate learning assistants who have previously completed the course in leadership roles, or (c) rotating peer leaders drawn from current students in the course. The project plans to assess  the effectiveness of these three approaches across several dimensions, including cost, student retention and course completion rates, student performance on subject matter assessments, and surveys assessing student leadership capacity and attitudes. While active learning practices are generally known to improve student success and learning, the specific cost and efficacy of different modalities may vary and is not well understood. Situated in a Hispanic Serving Institution, this project hopes to provide insights about sustainable, low-cost active learning formats in undergraduate STEM education that could be broadly relevant. Also, the project should advance understanding of how implementing different approaches to student leadership roles into STEM courses might promote student success and retention, while also developing students\u2019 leadership skills. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE: HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate\u2019s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
