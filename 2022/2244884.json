 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been theorized that land surface and elevation changes play a role in tornado formation and intensity changes.  However, most studies have either been idealized modeling efforts or case studies on a particular event.  This award will provide funding to develop a climatology of tornado interactions with the surface with a goal of answering several pressing questions about how tornadoes are impacted by surface characteristics.  The main societal impact of the project is the potential for improving tornado warning accuracy, which is a significant public safety issue.  The project also involves outreach and training activities to improve public understanding of science and develop the next generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nThis overarching goal of the study is to determine if statistical relationships can be retrieved that correlate tornado formation/decay and intensity to non-atmospheric surface features such as land cover and topography.  The researcher plans to combine a large database of radar and damage survey data with GIS-based digital elevation maps and national land cover data sets to answer the following questions:  1) What is the statistical relationship between topographic characteristics or changes in topography and tornado intensity? 2) What is the statistical relationship between land cover characteristics changes in land cover and changes in tornado intensity? 3) Are relationships in (1) and (2) sensitive to a tornado's intensity? 4) What is the spatial relationship between tornadogenesis/decay locations and land cover type or topography?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The data used included rapid-scan, mobile radar data from the University of Oklahoma&rsquo;s Rapid-Scan, X-band, polarimetric radar, digital elevation model datasets and land cover type datasets from the United States Geological Survey. Fundamentally, the questions investigated included: 1) How does terrain modify tornado intensity and structure, and 2) How does land cover modify tornado intensity and structure. Additional sub-questions included investigating if land cover type and terrain characteristics in a large-scale perspective (i.e., specific mountains/plateus/river valleys, etc.) and small-scale (localized pockets of trees vs fields, or small hills) may contribute to increased likelihood of tornado formation or dissipation. In brief, it was determined that terrain and land cover both can play direct roles in modulating tornado intensity, path, and structure (in terms of the distribution of rotating and vertical winds around the tornado&rsquo;s center), but the effects were not consistent from case to case. For example, in some scenarios, tornadoes intensified moving uphill while in other scenarios they weakened moving uphill. Furthermore, preliminary work was performed employing a highly sophisticated numerical model where simplified terrain and land cover characteristics were included to study their effects on tornados in a controlled environment, where the parent storm and larger scale atmospheric conditions were held constant. &nbsp;This work is important because it has been unclear to date how such physical variations in the land surface can cause changes in tornado intensity and structure.</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of this project, this work was disseminated to the broader scientific community through publications, and particularly through conference presentations. 4 journal articles were produced, and 15 presentations delivered by the PI, with 6 additional presentations delivered by student research assistants.
