 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the evolutionary mechanisms that generate biodiversity is crucial for conserving and managing species over the long term. Much of the planet\u2019s biodiversity has been generated through adaptive radiation, a process in which a group of organisms diversifies into many new species with different ecological roles. However, we lack a thorough understanding of the genomic changes underlying these events, particularly in marine ecosystems where there are no obvious barriers to migration. Rockfishes in the genus Sebastes are a highly diverse (>110 species) group of fishes that live across a range of depths and habitats, making them an excellent model for studying the dynamics of diversification. This CAREER project will advance our understanding of how species diversify by examining the genomic processes underlying speciation in rockfishes, as well as the accompanying shifts in habitat, body shape, size and color among sister species. This research program is integrated with educational activities, including undergraduate research opportunities and teacher training, with the goal of contributing to a strong and diverse workforce in science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThis study will combine genomic data with information on phenotypic diversity, ecology and biogeography to develop a holistic understanding of the dynamics of diversification in this extraordinarily species-rich genus. The first aim of the project is to construct an updated, time-calibrated phylogenetic framework for rockfishes using phylogenomic methods. In the second aim, whole genome sequencing will be used to infer likely divergence scenarios among sympatric species pairs, characterize patterns of genomic differentiation, and reconstruct demographic histories of lineages in the context of speciation events and oceanographic data. The third aim will examine the correspondence between genomic and ecomorphological divergence by assessing overlap between sister species across a suite of habitat factors and quantitative phenotypic characters. These research aims will be integrated with educational objectives via the development of a scaffolded set of classroom-based undergraduate research experiences, and the creation of a learning and mentoring community focused around biodiversity and evolutionary genetics. The project will also support the development of K12 STEM teachers in rural communities by engaging and training pre-service teachers in the principles of evolutionary biology and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
