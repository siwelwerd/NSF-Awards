These meetings bring together scientists from around the world to focus on research at the forefront of photonuclear reactions. The conference is organized in a way to promote significant discussion and time for collaboration throughout the week. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for a limited number of junior researchers to attend the 2022 GRC. The support for the participants will be selected by the chairs based on submitted abstracts of their research. This support will allow participants to attend these meetings who may otherwise not be able to attend. Participation of young researchers in these meetings plays a large role in the development of the future leaders of nuclear science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
