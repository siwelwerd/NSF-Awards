 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of U.S.-based mathematicians, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty, in the \u201cFifth Workshop on Nonlinear Dispersive Equations,\u201d held November 8-11, 2022, at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This is a collaborative meeting in the area of analysis and nonlinear differential equations that is geared towards creating international connections, especially for junior mathematicians, by bringing together North and South American researchers in the field. The workshop will provide collaborative, educational, and networking opportunities for a significant number of researchers working in nonlinear wave equations and offers unique professional opportunities to early-career U.S.-based researchers, including those from historically underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. This is the fifth such meeting in its series; previous meetings have been increasingly successful in promoting research that studies nonlinear models, waves, turbulence, and singularities arising in various practical applications, including rogue waves and air turbulence, optics and communication, and mechanics. \r\n   \r\nThe field of nonlinear evolution equations has been experiencing dramatic growth over the last thirty years. New ideas and techniques have enabled mathematicians to explore questions that previously seemed intractable, and the work has led to advances in understanding several fundamental nonlinear wave equations such as the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger, Korteweg-de Vries, Benjamin-Ono, and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, including their various generalizations and extensions. However, some important questions, such as the description of stable and coherent structures, are yet to be fully explored. The conference will focus on common questions associated with the mathematical description of nonlinear dispersive models and the latest advances in the field. Additional information can be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/v-wnde\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
