 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide support for participants to attend a week-long conference on Equidistribution and Arithmetic Dynamics that will be held at Oklahoma State University during June 2022. The conference will consist of equal parts dissemination and education; that is, it will offer both a discussion of current research, and the opportunity for education in the area, bringing participants to the forefront of current techniques and research. Besides the daily plenary presentations, this will be done by including mini-courses and problem sessions for earlier career researchers and graduate students, and a particular effort will be made to recruit women and participants from historically underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe topic of equidistribution is classical in Number Theory. However, there have been many fundamental advances in the study of distribution for algebraic numbers, and more generally, for points of small height in various number theoretic settings, during the latest two decades. Thus, a conference dedicated to this circle of problems is both timely and necessary. It will summarize major achievements, and will also facilitate exchange of ideas and methods between various directions of research in this rapidly developing area. There will be several problem sessions and discussion groups that will help to compile a list of problems and set possible approaches to their solutions. This conference will greatly stimulate future progress and collaboration on equidistribution problems between mathematicians from different fields and backgrounds. For more information, see the conference website  https://cas.okstate.edu/department_of_mathematics/department_of_mathematics_ead.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
