 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students, highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. The need for cultivating STEM talent has been well established. For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. \r\n\r\nSt. Mary\u2019s University, Our Lady of the Lake University, Trinity University, and the University of the Incarnate Word, all Primarily Undergraduate Universities (PUIs) in San Antonio, have formed the PUI-SATX Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, a new STEM Pathways Implementation-Only (SPIO) alliance.  This alliance of institutions will target students in low socioeconomic zip codes primarily in Central Texas for participation in STEM interventions leading to the STEM baccalaureate degree and preparation for entry into STEM graduate degree programs.  Activities will include stipend support, participation in experiential research, peer mentoring, mentoring circles and other STEM professional development activities.  Activities will incorporate family members in recruitment and retention activities such as La Familia orientations. The PUI-SATX LSAMP project will disseminate its project findings broadly via its website and through STEM professional communities and publications such as the Journal of STEM Education and Journal of Research in STEM Education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
