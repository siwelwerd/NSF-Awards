 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Medical Innovations in Extended Reality (MIXR) integrates computer science and engineering with medical and clinical sciences to develop and establish scientific foundations for designing and assessing medical extended reality (XR) applications. Working with industry partners to broaden the safe deployment of XR, the Center focuses on new technologies and regulatory pathways to improve healthcare equity and access, patient management, and medical outcomes across all areas of clinical practice.\r\n\r\nMIXR has identified driving applications in clinical practice, medical education and training, and regulatory standards. The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) contributes to the Center with unique capabilities in: predictive modeling (AI-assisted methods to identify anomalies in medical data), human factors (pilot and field evaluation of XR solutions), and imaging and displays (conceptual design and iterative user studies for prototype XR tools in medical environments). The team at UMB will work from the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine focusing on XR in trauma, surgery, and critical care applications.\r\n\r\nXR device evaluation lags significantly behind technological innovation, increasing the risk of ineffective or unsafe applications and delaying clinical implementation. This effort\u2019s broader impact will be addressing open research questions for the evaluation of medical XR devices. Supporting NSF\u2019s mission, this will assure public safety around these technologies and improve health care outcomes. In collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, project outcomes will provide the scientific foundation supporting regulatory requirements on and decisions regarding medical XR devices. Further, MIXR\u2019s multi-faceted strategic approach for creating educational opportunities for underrepresented students focuses on access, community, and innovation.\r\n\r\nData, software, findings, and publications resulting from this project will be archived across the sites, but with a central server at http://mixr.umd.edu to facilitate ease of discovery. Research and archival staff will review the data collected during this project before release to the public. It shall be publicly available for at least three years after the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
