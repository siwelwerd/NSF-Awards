 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Undergraduate Spectrum Workshop (USW) is a 3-4 day invited workshop hosted by Baylor University that focuses on recruiting new undergraduate students into future training and career opportunities in electromagnetic spectrum research and electromagnetic spectrum management. The fields of spectrum research and spectrum management are of increasing importance to the nation as next generation communications and device-connectivity networks are becoming a greater part of our everyday lives. To remain a global leader in next generation communications and to ensure the health, prosperity, and welfare of the nation that will be enabled by future generations of increasingly connected devices, it is critical to develop a workforce talent pipeline that is aware of the critical role that spectrum research and spectrum management play in our lives and that is expertly trained to lead the academic, industrial, and federal labs of the future that will produce continued advances in this area. This conference addresses these goals of high national importance.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will recruit students and faculty from small regional colleges nearby Baylor that have a high composition of underrepresented minority students. The workshop is based on and borrows experience from a similarly designed and successful workshop previously hosted at Baylor University with similar goals to recruit students into training and careers in chemistry. The goal of the workshop is to introduce students to spectrum career paths and to recruit them into spectrum training programs and a potential future spectrum career. The activities during the 3-4 day workshop will include content delivery from academic and industry experts and will also have a strong focus on interactive activities for students. The students will be arranged in small groups of 5-10 participants to maximize the individual impact. Activities will be cross-disciplinary including a mock spectrum trial, a spectrum filter design and measurement exercise, and testing of homemade radar systems. Post-activity panel sessions will discuss spectrum career paths, graduate school options, and other topics of practical interest to students. Participants will be housed at Baylor during the workshop and have a chance to interact with potential future faculty mentors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe \"Spectrum Sizzle\" Undergraduate Spectrum workshop was held on June 5-8, 2023 with 15 student participants, and again on June 3-6, 2024, with 41 student participants and a waiting list of over 100 students. Undergraduate students gathered for this four-day residential event and completed lectures and hands-on activities focused on the topics of Spectrum Policy, Communication Systems, Radar Systems, Passive Systems, and Circuits. Panel sessions included explorations into Spectrum Careers and Graduate School. The workshop was hosted by SMART Hub (Hub for Spectrum Management with Adaptive and Reconfigurable Technology, a Department of Defense Spectrum Innovation Center) on the campus of Baylor University. The workshop was developed and executed in collaboration with Keysight Technologies. In addition to providing test equipment for laboratory exercises, Keysight organized a campus transmitter hunt, where students were able to use hand-held spectrum analyzers in a competition to locate hidden transmitters. \r\n\n\nThe goal of this undergraduate workshop was to generate interest in spectrum science and engineering and to grow a diverse workforce in this area. Undergraduate student participants were recruited from across the United States, with a focus in recruiting on Historically Black Colleges and University, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and universities not necessarily providing sigificant research exposure to undergraduate students. In 2024, 33 percent of participants were African American, and approximately 30 percent of participants were female. Additionally, 45 percent were first-generation-in-college students.\r\n\n\nThe benefit of this residential experience to all participants was the opportunity to build relationships with experts in the field of spectrum science and engineering who served as clinicians, and to gain hands-on experience. As a result of NSF's investment in this workshop, 141 undergraduate students have been given access to the growing area of wireless spectrum. Additionally, significant workforce development curricular content has been developed that can further be used in professional training, as well as exposure for K-12 students to spectrum. Additionally, workforce developers have been developed that can continue to expand this undergraduate outreach opportunity. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CharlesPBaylis\n"
