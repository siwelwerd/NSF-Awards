 "awd_abstract_narration": "Empirical study of the Internet provides a foundation for understanding how the infrastructure is deployed, operated and used, and enables improvements in systems, protocols and processes.  However, empirical study is fraught with challenges in the collection and analysis of data.  Addressing these challenges is crucial to on-going empirical study of the Internet and to broadening the scope of measurement-based research. \r\n\r\nThis project will plan and direct a two-day workshop that will bring together about 30 experts from the fields of Internet measurement, statistics and mathematics to discuss current challenges and identify important and promising future research directions and opportunities. This workshop is motivated by the new NSF Internet Measurement Research: Methodologies, Tools, and Infrastructure (IMR) program, which is a collaboration between Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) to \u201csupport methodologies, tools, and research infrastructure for Internet measurement spanning access (both wireless and fixed broadband) and core Internet.\u201d  This workshop will provide a forum for researchers who work on different aspects of Internet measurement to communicate and interact with statisticians and mathematicians.  Specific opportunities for information exchange and collaboration between these communities include avoiding pitfalls in managing and analyzing large, diverse data sets, and creating novel methods for collecting, anonymizing, modeling, and analyzing Internet measurement data.  \r\n\r\nThe in-person workshop will be organized around keynote talks, focus group sessions and working group discussions. During the workshop, statisticians and mathematicians will have opportunities to learn about the current topics in Internet measurement research and the challenges and practical issues related to Internet measurement research. Likewise, Internet measurement researchers will have the opportunities to learn about the latest developments and advances in statistical models, algorithms and methodologies for collecting and analyzing large and complex datasets. \r\n\r\nThe workshop aims to facilitate interactions and encourage future collaborations between participants.  This will pave the way for research projects and will have a significant impact on the theory and practice in Internet measurement research, and will drive the development of new statistical and learning-based techniques. The workshop will also benefit the education and training of next-generation researchers and practitioners by exposing participants to new ideas and techniques spanning Internet measurement, statistics and mathematics.  A report summarizing the workshop will be published after its conclusion.  A website for the workshop will be available at http://imrworkshop22.cs.wisc.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
