 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a wearable technology to benefit individuals with sustpected cardiovascular abnormalities by early detection of disease through outside-the-clinic monitoring. Early detection of cardiovascular diseases allows for timely interventions including medication, surgical procedures, and valve replacement. The unobtrusive nature of the proposed technology may contribute to a smooth and comfortable experience, encouraging patients to comply with the diagnostic process. This improved compliance, along with  dietary and lifestyle modifications, may lead to improvements in societal health outcomes by decreasing hospitalization rates and the associated costs. Outside-the-clinic monitoring may obviate the need for subsequent clinical visits, shortening the diagnostic timeline from weeks to days and  reducing cardiologists\u2019 workload.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a prescription-based wearable sensor patch for the continuous assessment of cardiovascular patients for periods of up to two weeks. This sensor patch leverages microphones and inertial measurement units (i.e. accelerometers and gyroscopes) to capture heartbeat-induced sounds and vibrations on the chest wall, respectively. A software tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) is developed to inform cardiologists of abnormal events and patterns in the cardiac signals along with their corresponding timestamps. The technology also offers hemodynamic features such as systolic and diastolic time intervals and heart rate variability parameters to assist cardiologists with the decision-making process. This device is an alternative to traditional Holter monitors and single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) sensors that are inconvenient to wear for extended periods of time and do not represent the mechanical activities of the heart. The machine learning (ML)-based fusion method designed for cardio-mechanical and cardio-acoustic modalities may also be adapted to other bio-mechanical and bio-acoustic monitoring applications such as joint and bone health monitoring, where abnormal crepitus might be indicators of joint malfunctions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
