 "awd_abstract_narration": "The classification of smooth structures on 4-dimensional topological spaces is surprisingly subtle and complex, and far from understood. Lower dimensions (1, 2, and 3) do not have enough room for interesting problems to arise, while there is ample space to resolve them in higher dimensions (above 4). A consequence of this is that many well-known questions remain unanswered only smoothly in dimension 4, such as the Poincar\u00e9 and Sch\u00f6nflies conjectures first posed in 1904 and 1908, respectively. The primary goal of this project is to advance the mathematical techniques and machinery necessary for the eventual resolution of these outstanding problems. This will be achieved by studying relatively \"simple\" smooth 4-manifolds and their submanifolds up to various notions of equivalence, through manipulating surfaces within these manifolds and understanding limitations on how these surfaces intersect and embed. As a broader impact, the PI is passionately involved with the Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI) at Princeton University, a program recruiting volunteer graduate students, postdocs, and faculty to teach college courses to incarcerated students in New Jersey Department of Corrections institutions. The PI is actively working with the PTI to co-develop a new math course for non-math majors to be offered as part of the BA curriculum, examining legal cases in which mathematics has been used (both correctly and incorrectly) in the courtroom. The PI is also designing and co-teaching a course in which students learn basic knot theory by using it to model circus arts such as aerial acrobatics, juggling, and tightrope walking. The PI is currently working with undergraduate students to compile their insights and observations from the first iteration of this course, with the goal of publishing these results in an undergraduate journal.\r\n\r\nThe classification of closed, simply-connected 4-manifolds up to homeomorphism is well understood, due to groundbreaking work of Freedman from the 80's. The goal of this research project is to further understand the difference between the smooth and topological categories in dimension 4. Examples of compact topological 4-manifolds admitting infinitely many distinct smooth structures were first produced by Friedman and Morgan, using the work of Donaldson. In contrast, compact topological manifolds of dimension other than four admit at most finitely many smooth structures. The PI is interested in developing concrete and useful methods of relating pairs of smooth 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. In particular, the project will focus on (1) smooth 4-manifolds up to \"stable\" diffeomorphism, i.e. modulo connected summing with copies of the product S^2 \u00d7 S^2, (2) the diffeomorphism types of topological 4-balls that embed in the standard 4-sphere, and (3) embeddings of contractible manifolds called corks up to regular homotopy and topological isotopy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
