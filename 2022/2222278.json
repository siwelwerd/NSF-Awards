 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThis postdoctoral fellowship research project will undertake a comparative study of undergraduate research experiences for Latinx students at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) using an asset-based framework and Chicana/Latina feminist epistemology and the \"platicas methodology\" (or informal conversations). The study is expected to provide insights about the campus context of HSIs that influence STEM retention of Latinx students through their participation in undergraduate research experiences. In addition to conducting a research project, the fellow will implement a professional development plan designed to expand her methodological training in quantitative (social network analysis) and mixed methods research design and to gain pedagogical and mentoring tools to work with diverse students. The fellow\u2019s future research directions include investigating the intersectional identities of Latinx students in STEM and exploration of STEM graduate pathways that embrace Latinx culture. \r\n\r\nThe study aims to examine the social and cultural assets that Latinx use in two research-intensive HSI settings. Guided by asset-based frameworks, Rendon\u2019s Latinx STEM Success Model, and the Community-Centered STEM Identity Model, the project will employ both a qualitative culturally relevant methodology known as \"platicas,\" and a quantitative methodology based in social network analysis. A transformative design was chosen, as this study aims to use culturally relevant methods with a marginalized student group (Latinx students in STEM) with the goal of transforming STEM outcomes. In addition, a Chicana/Latina Feminist epistemology will provide an overarching framework for the study. The study provides an intersectional approach by centering Latinx STEM students who are also first-generation college students. It line of inquiry holds potential to provide insights into the unique campus context of HSIs in advancing STEM retention through participation in undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project responds to the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\r\n\r\nThis project is partially funded by The Kaleta A. Doolin Foundation through a partnership with the National Science Foundation to promote greater diversity within the STEM/STEM education research workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
