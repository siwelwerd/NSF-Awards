 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds travel expenses for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career investigators, in particular individuals from underrepresented groups, so they may present research results and participate in the American Physiological Society (APS) Intersociety Meeting, Comparative Physiology: From Organisms to Omics in an Uncertain World, in San Diego, California, October 28-31, 2022. The meeting provides a venue for the presentation of significant advances in understanding the integrative physiology of organisms, including humans and other animals. This meeting is an opportunity for comparative physiologists to report their newest research discoveries and to develop collaborations that spark scientific innovation. Broader impacts of the meeting include significant advancement of knowledge about organismal physiology, greater participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in comparative physiology research, and development of a globally diverse and more collaborative research workforce. \r\n\r\nThe 2022 APS Intersociety Meeting, Comparative Physiology: From Organisms to Omics in an Uncertain World, seeks to promote the exchange of ideas and development of future collaborations of comparative and evolutionary physiologists internationally, and to encourage trainees, early career investigators, and individuals from underrepresented groups to pursue research careers in this discipline. The conference includes plenary lectures, symposia, contributed oral and poster presentations, presentations on technological/educational advances in the field, and a workshop on the use of open electronics in comparative physiology. In order to achieve the conference objectives, APS will administer a travel grant program offering travel awards to trainees (undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and early career investigators, in particular individuals from underrepresented groups (women, racial/ethnic minorities, and disabled persons), who submit abstracts to be presented at the meeting. It is expected that travel for at least 21 individuals will be supported. The project will contribute to broadening the participation of young scientists, with an emphasis on members of under-represented groups, exposing them to cutting edge physiological research and providing unique opportunities for professional development and networking. A \u201cperspectives\u201d report that summarizes and synthesizes the content and discussions, to advance the study of organismal responses to a changing world, will be prepared.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology (IEP) and Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics (PMB) Programs in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
