 "awd_abstract_narration": "Web-based and digital tools to support math and science learning have emerged as a major trend over the past several decades. As of 2013, all 50 states and the District of Columbia offer online learning experiences to K\u201312 students, ranging from supplemental courses that accompany traditional in-person instruction to full-time online schools. Understanding the promise and limitations of remote learning is an urgent line of research now because of increased reliance on remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and continued disruptions to schooling have been associated with substantial setbacks in learning. Studies examining academic progress between March 2020 and March 2021 reported significant lack of progress, which was particularly pronounced in math and science relative to reading. Furthermore, lack of progress was greatest among subgroups that already experience achievement disparities in math and science, such as students of color, rural students, and those eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes evidence surrounding math and science remote education programs from the past 15 years. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of math and science remote education programs; how their effectiveness varies by program characteristics (e.g., fully online vs. hybrid, synchronous vs. asynchronous, and student-instructor ratio); and whether their effects vary with student sample characteristics. To prioritize future research needs, the researchers will create evidence gap maps to illuminate patterns in the existing evidence base and identify areas in which evidence is lacking. This analysis will build foundational knowledge and inform educators about which programs and strategies in math and science remote education have been most effective. In addition, the review will provide targeted guidance on which programs and strategies have been most appropriate for vulnerable groups of students.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
