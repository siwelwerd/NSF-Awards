 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the 2022 Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI), a six-week summer workshop bringing a broad pool of students into geometry processing and related research disciplines.  A cohort of roughly 30 SGI Fellows will complete a week of intensive training in geometry processing research practices, followed by five weeks of collaboration with top researchers in the field, guest lectures, guidance on graduate admissions, and interaction with one another; an additional group of students is invited to participate in only the initial tutorial week.  Designed to broaden access to geometry processing research experiences, the program targets Fellows drawn from a diverse set of backgrounds, geographic locations, and institutions, with a focus on students otherwise unlikely to have access to this cutting-edge discipline. Fellows receive stipends to alleviate the opportunity cost of participating in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe SGI 2022 offering aims to develop SGI as a supporter of the geometry processing community and as a model program for computational and mathematical disciplines seeking to broaden the diversity of future generations of researchers. Beyond community-building, SGI Fellows will tackle real-world research problems affecting applications like digital manufacturing, virtual reality, physical simulation, architecture, and autonomous driving using tools drawn from mathematical disciplines including differential geometry, partial differential equations, optimal transport, numerical analysis, and optimization. More information can be found on the program website, at: https://sgi.mit.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSupport from this grant was used to continue the Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) in 2022, a summer program introducing undergraduates and early master's students to research in applied geometry.\n\nSGI 2022 took place during six weeks in summer 2022.  The program supported a cohort of 34 SGI Fellows, who participated in the program full-time; an additional cohort of ~20 students were invited to participate in the initial week.  The first week of the program featured a set of daily tutorials and interactive exercises intended to introduce participants to key theoretical concepts and software tools in geometry processing research, with no assumption on past experience in the field (beyond basic linear algebra, calculus, and programming skills).  The remaining five weeks were dedicated to research experiences, mostly 1-2 week research collaborations led by top faculty and research scientists in the field.\n\nSGI 2022 was overwhelmingly successful, exceeding expectations for the technical and broader impact-oriented aims of the program.  Some highlights are included below:\n\nA central aim of SGI is to bring a diverse set of new members to the geometry processing community.  78.8% of SGI Fellows self-identified as members of an underrepresented group in computing or mathematical sciences, and numerous countries were represented among the fellows.\nAfter the program, many SGI Fellows reported that they were likely to pursue graduate education (MS, PhD) in geometry processing and related fields.  PhD admissions are ongoing as of this report, and already we have seen 5-10 of our cohort of Fellows continuing to top PhD programs in mathematics and computing in the USA and abroad.  Several SGI faculty mentors reported they were likely to recruit SGI Fellows for their research groups.\nSimilarly to the previous offering, SGI 2022 was held completely online.  The program pioneered techniques in online research-based education that we plan to use over the longer term.\nMIT EECS has used SGI as a model program for efforts promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) among applicants for our graduate program.  It is now included in MIT EECS's strategic plan for DEI efforts moving forward.\nSeveral research projects launched during SGI continued beyond the end of the program, and we are currently seeing resulting papers submitted to top conferences and journals in our discipline.\n\n\nReaders are invited to visit the SGI 2022 blog for write-ups by SGI Fellows describing some of the many projects they completed:  http://summergeometry.org/sgi2022\n\nData collection among the participants (Fellows and mentors) reflected many of the positive points above.
