 "awd_abstract_narration": "Companies in the Buffalo metropolitan area employ more than 37,000 workers in the software, IT, cybersecurity, networking, and data analytics fields. These companies rely on cybersecurity technicians to protect computer systems and networks from theft and damage. There is an acute need in the region for cybersecurity technicians since supply has not kept pace with the rapidly growing demand. The goal of this project is to create an educational pathway, in a high-poverty region, to produce cybersecurity technicians who can help address this workforce need. This will be accomplished by designing and implementing dual enrollment courses in two partnering high schools that will lead to matriculation in a postsecondary cybersecurity program. Upon graduation students will have earned either a postsecondary certificate or an AAS degree in cybersecurity qualifying them for employment as technicians in the cybersecurity field.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project include (1) implementing dual enrollment courses with high school partners, (2) providing professional development for high school and college faculty to improve technician education, (3) marketing the program, (4) enrolling students in a pathway of stackable industry certifications, (5) fostering student success through individualized support and mentoring, and (6) strengthening student connections to the workforce through work-based learning opportunities. A qualitative study will examine student perceptions of the benefits of the dual enrollment program to accelerate entry into the workforce and the effectiveness of peer supports targeted to underrepresented groups. This project was developed in consultation with NCyTE, an ATE center for cybersecurity, whose broad reach will be leveraged to disseminate project materials and findings.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
