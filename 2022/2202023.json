 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions increases the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project, submitted by Din\u00e9 College and titled \u201cMaster of Science in Biology\u201d directly aligns with that goal. Through a collaborative effort, the project establishes a thesis-based Master of Science in Biology built on the solid foundation of the college\u2019s multiple STEM BS degrees, including Biology, its faculty members\u2019 expertise, the knowledge of local cultural experts, and the college\u2019s substantive STEM infrastructure. The degree includes a rigorous slate of courses, including field and laboratory courses, focused on STEM content knowledge and research skills, as well as a strong cultural grounding to support the success of Indigenous students. The project advances the degree offerings at Din\u00e9 College to include graduate study, enabling the matriculation of researchers prepared to work in STEM professions in diverse settings.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Science in Biology degree at Din\u00e9 College is designed to prepare Indigenous and other students with an advanced understanding of biology concepts, research techniques, and sub-discipline-specific expertise. Students will engage in the western graduate education process to expand their knowledge vertically and horizontally through both intellectual understanding and practical experience, enabling graduates to advance to higher levels of employment and educational opportunities. By also integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge and developing their understanding of the significance of cultural knowledge in scientific and social realms, the program will have transformative effects, catalyzing graduates\u2019 abilities to apply their learning and interpret their work in culturally sensitive ways. The project advances the degree offerings at Din\u00e9 College to include graduate study, enabling the matriculation of researchers prepared to work in STEM professions in diverse settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
