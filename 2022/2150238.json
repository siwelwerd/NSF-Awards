 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer REU on Resilient Carbon-Free U.S. Electric Power Systems at Clarkson University will provide research opportunities focused on a sustainable and resilient U.S. electricity power grid by 2035. Each year, a cohort of 10 undergraduate students, with an emphasis on attracting participants from research limited institutes will be recruited to participate in the summer research. These REU students will be mentored by Clarkson faculty and conduct research into data analytics, machine learning, advanced control, and power system analysis for improved grid resiliency and grid integration of renewable energies. Professional development activities will include invited seminars and field trips hosted by the industry partners, e.g., National Grid, New York Power Authority, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory, to broaden students\u2019 knowledge of energy infrastructures. The outcome of the program will be the next generation of engineers and scientists with interdisciplinary knowledge to address the pressing challenges faced by this country\u2019s electric power grid for a sustainable and resilient energy system of the future. \r\n\r\nClarkson University will host a new 3-year REU site featuring a ten-week immersive summer research program for ten undergraduate students annually. The REU has a goal of attracting at least 50% of the students will be from two- or four-year colleges with limited research resources. The program\u2019s distinguishing elements include: (1) research projects addressing the challenges faced by the power industry to achieve the nationwide goal of resilient carbon-free U.S. electric power systems by 2035; (2) professional development activities such as training of ethics in research, communication skills, and preparing a strong application to graduate school to foster students\u2019 educational & career development; and (3) bootcamp on grid resiliency and sustainability, field trips and invited talks to stimulate and sustain students\u2019 interest in graduate studies in the electric power sector. These research activities will focus on resiliency and carbon-free grids of the future including grid assets hardening with 5G networks, renewable integration, data analytics for outage management, converter control for solar and offshore wind, and cyber-resilient control of distributed energy resources. Following the summer experience, mentors will support their students to submit appropriate research results for publication in peer-reviewed IEEE conferences/journals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
