 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. West Chester University of Pennsylvania is acquiring a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) coupled to an energy dispersive spectrometer to support the research of Professor Kurt Kolasinski and colleagues Howell Bosbyshell, Brandon Mitchell, John Pisciotta, and LeeAnn Srogi. This instrument facilitates research in chemistry, biology, physics, geology, and earth sciences. Scanning electron microscopy is used to image and understand chemical phenomena at the nano and mesoscales. A focused electron beam, which is scanned over a surface to generate a SEM image and subsequently produces signals, reveals information about the composition and topology of a sample. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. The instrument is leveraged by at least three departments and in outreach activities with local community colleges and organizations.\r\n\r\nThe award for the FE-SEM is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as biology, chemistry, earth sciences, and physics. Research focuses on nanomaterial structure elucidation, interactions of nanoparticles with the environment, and fundamental Earth materials and processes that encompass imaging and microanalysis. High-resolution imaging and chemical analysis are key for studying thin films, nanomaterials, and porous solids so that we size-structure-property relationships can be established. In addition, other investigations include evaluation of antimicrobial activity of metallic nanoparticles against pure bacterial cultures and microbial communities in biofilms to better understand nano-ecotoxicology. It also assists in reconstructing microscale textures and chemical compositions of mineral grains, integrating spatial-composition of model tectono-thermal evolution of mountain belts and magma chamber processes associated with volcanic hazards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
