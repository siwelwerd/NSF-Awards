 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum sensors rely on the unique physical properties of nature at the atomic and subatomic scales to detect phenomena that evade identification in the human-scaled realm of lived experience. As such quantum behavior finds increasingly more applications, there is a growing need for a workforce prepared to discover, develop, and deploy the science and engineering advancements in this emerging field. In addition, awareness of how discoveries in the lab can impact the economy and the private sector is critical to harnessing these developments for society to benefit. To capitalize on such developments, this NSF Research Traineeships (NRT) project, \"Linking Quantum Sensing TechnoLogies across Disciplines (LinQ-STL),\" is establishing an interdisciplinary program of study to connect research efforts across the St. Louis region between Washington University, the University of Missouri \u2013 St. Louis, St. Louis University, and Harris Stowe State University. The project\u2019s vision is to build quantum fluency among scientists and engineers spanning the disciplines of chemistry, biology, physics, medicine, engineering, and mathematics. LinQ-STL achieves these goals by building common vocabulary, research community awareness, research identity, and technical skills that will prepare the trainees to launch a range of professional careers. The project anticipates training 100 students, including 40 funded trainees from chemistry, physics, computer, and electrical and system engineering doctorate programs. Furthermore, the project's investigators seek to create institutional change in graduate education by demonstrating how career-building internships and experiences aligned with students\u2019 professional interests can affect their career trajectories and success. This model will be broadly disseminated to other disciplines and institutions.\r\n\r\nThree essential areas guide the experimental, theoretical, and computational work of this project: \u201clooking out\u201d beyond the Earth into the universe; \u201clooking in\u201d to meso- and microscopic domains of quantum bits and materials phenomena; and \u201clooking where we cannot yet see\u201d comprising efforts to identify heretofore unmeasured domains such as dark matter detection. LinQ-STL will pursue opportunities for quantum sensing, with cross-cutting themes such as new instrumentation and new materials, data-enabled science via machine learning, and photon detection over decades of energy scales. Researchers \u201clooking out\u201d (astrophysics) will develop observational tools across orders of magnitude in photon energy, enabling the acquisition of massive data sets. Researchers \u201clooking in\u201d at the smallest material length scales will use photon spectroscopies and the unexpected benefits of materials defects to probe new behaviors. Finally, \u201clooking where we cannot yet see\u201d includes new quantum light imaging modalities applicable in biology and medical imaging, and new probes of topological and quantum phenomena in materials. Research by the project team will also probe how students perceive themselves as science learners via their science identity, racial and gender identity, and efficacy beliefs\u2014to diversify the workforce by acknowledging the role of identity in enabling students to become the next generation of leaders and teachers.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. Because of its alignment with the research thrusts within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the project is receiving co-funding from the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
