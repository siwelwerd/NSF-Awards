 "awd_abstract_narration": "SONG in New Mexico is a robotic telescope combined with an ultra-precise spectrograph that will be an addition to the Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG). This international collaboration will obtain near-continuous observations of bright, oscillating stars in order to study their structure.  Understanding stars is a fundamental goal of astrophysics as stars are the most basic building blocks of galaxies and the universe. This will be the only U.S. participating facility in the global SONG project. It will provide the key link to allow 24-hour coverage that is needed to accomplish the scientific goals. The observations will lead to an improved understanding of a wide variety of stars, including target stars that host Earth-like planets. This new facility overlaps significantly with the interests of the students and faculty in astronomy at New Mexico State University, providing long-term educational and research benefits and commitment.\r\n\r\nOscillating stars have turbulent motions within them that generate sound waves that cause the majority of them to wobble and ring like bells. The measurement and analysis of these acoustic oscillations is the primary means to study the interior of a star. This project will acquire and assemble a telescope and spectrograph instrument that will close a gap in the world-wide SONG network dedicated to monitoring oscillating stars 24 hours per day. The state-of-the-art spectrograph comes from a well-tested design and has already demonstrated radial-velocity precision of about 1 meter-per-second. The goals this facility enables are to perform asteroseismology of stars to obtain the most detailed information possible, and to search for and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. It complements past, current, and future space missions with similar science goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
