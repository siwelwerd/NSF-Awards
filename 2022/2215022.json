 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Duke University is acquiring a microscale thermophoresis system to advance the research of Professor Amanda Hargrove and colleagues. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical biology. Microscale thermophoresis directly measures molecular movement in a temperature gradient to quantify molecular interactions. Signals are quantified by measuring fluorescence arising from labeling or intrinsic properties. The resulting measurements provide structural and functional characterization of interactions between biological, inorganic, and organic molecules. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. Notably, the instrument would be leveraged in undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory courses where students gain hands on experience with the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe award for the microscale thermophoresis system is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as organic and inorganic chemistry, chemical biology, biopolymers, and biochemistry. Research focuses on measuring binding interactions between RNA and small molecules, peptides and metal ions, and other biomolecules and small molecules. In addition, domain-domain interactions in enzymes, proteins, and cells are pursued.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
