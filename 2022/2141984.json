 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving student learning in an undergraduate statics course using immersive experiences based on augmented and mixed reality technologies. Statics is a foundational course in many engineering programs throughout the country. In this course, students find it especially challenging to solve engineering problems in which forces are applied to physical objects in a three-dimensional space. Students need to learn the spatial reasoning skills that are necessary to solve these complex problems. Without these skills, students can become frustrated with the course, which can affect student retention and persistence in engineering. This project will address these challenges by creating a three-dimensional learning environment that uses interactive software to help students learn foundational engineering concepts and develop three-dimensional spatial reasoning skills. This project will study the effectiveness of the learning environment and investigate the conditions that lead to improvements in student learning. The research has the potential to change how engineering students are taught in the early stages of engineering programs. Successful deployment of this technology in coursework could lead to broader adoption of immersive technology in statics courses. It is expected that student learning will improve, which would help improve retention rates in engineering. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to systematically build upon a theoretical and practical knowledge base of how a statics course can be enhanced with immersive technology to improve student learning, build spatial skills, and enhance student motivation. The three-dimensional learning environment will be tailored to major course topics such that students will be able to (a) perform three-dimensional manipulations that are impossible with only pencil and paper, (b) immerse themselves in an environment to interact with both real and computer-generated objects, and (c) learn challenging abstract concepts that are vital for success in engineering. The project will be conducted as a meta-design experiment where iterative design of the learning environment and empirical studies will guide continuous refinement of the technology. While the scope of the project is limited to engineering, the pedagogical approach can be generalized to other STEM courses that can benefit from immersive learning experiences. In addition, the software developed in this project will not be limited to a specific hardware platform so that it can be shared and adapted by institutions with different operating platforms. Evaluation of project outcomes will be conducted by an independent external evaluator. Project results will be disseminated using a website to develop a community of practice for researchers, engineering education conference presentations, and STEM education journals. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
