 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inaugural Northeast Workshop in Geometric Analysis (NEWGA) will be hosted at the University of Connecticut, November 5-6, 2022. The workshop will bring together experts who work in various areas of geometric analysis and will encourage the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs in the Northeastern US to foster new developments in geometric analysis. The workshop also aims to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.  Ensuring that members of underrepresented groups are well-represented among plenary speakers is a priority. Special efforts will be made to recruit participants from women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n             \r\nGeometric analysis is a rapidly developing area that has many interconnections to different branches of mathematics. The workshop will connect experts in the topics of Complex Analysis and Geometry, Fully Nonlinear PDEs, General Relativity, and Geometric Flows, and it will enhance collaborations across these areas in the Northeastern US. Besides plenary talks, an Emerging Leader Session is specifically designed to increase the involvement of students and early-career researchers by presenting their research. The workshop webpage is https://s.uconn.edu/newga.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
