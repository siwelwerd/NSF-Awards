 "awd_abstract_narration": "Management of agricultural land and soil (ALS) systems are often disconnected from societal goals of food security and environmental sustainability. The ALS network facilitates cooperation among scientific disciplines, policy makers, Federal and State Agencies, agricultural producers, private industry, NGO\u2019s, society members and land managers to develop resilient, sustainable practices of ALS in the context of both socioeconomic and biophysical interactions. This network would improve ALS management by considering changes to ALS management in a holistic way that considers equity, access to data, and information synthesis. This approach empowers diverse producers and land managers/stewards to adopt outcome-based (e.g., improved soil health, water quality and carbon sequestration) management. This team promotes research at the nexus of soil, water, land, and climate systems to increase sustainability of the management of agricultural land and soil. \r\n\r\nThe ALS network (ALSNet): 1) develops coordination and communication mechanisms, 2) establishes team science processes and culture across multiple professional disciplines and groups to convert knowledge into action, 3) identifies and prioritizes knowledge gaps and opportunities, and 4) trains the next generation of a diverse and global workforce to develop solutions for the complex challenges of ALS systems. The project employs a team science approach that engages diverse partners to enhance interdisciplinarity, conducts ideation workshops, collaborates around shared vision, and develops research questions and synthesis papers. ALSNet supports broader strategic collaboration among U.S. research networks, global networks, professional societies, and social networks to integrate data, knowledge, and information on theoretical and applied research.  It uses a global perspective to narrow the gaps of scaling complexities, to understand tradeoffs, and to empower stakeholders to address the grand challenges associated with ALS. The team integrates biophysical, social, economic, and behavioral sciences that enhances the knowledge to action plan. The project will cross institutional boundaries and engage diverse stakeholders including consumers and industry partners, in both developed and developing nations, in the scientific discovery and implementation processes to build a plan for putting knowledge into action. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
