 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating a newly discovered community of animals and microbes near deep-sea hydrothermal vents that appears to inhabit only cool, inactive sulfide features. The main objectives are to determine what species live on these features, whether they are new to science, and how they function in the community.  The discovery of this novel community, which may be fueled by production of resident microbes, is likely to change the way we think about inactive vents and their contribution to deep-sea biodiversity and productivity.   This project has broad impact in four different areas: 1) Informing policy for sustainable use (mining) of inactive sulfides; 2) Contributing to global data systems and the NSF-funded repository at BCO-DMO to make our data available for research use at other temporal, spatial, and taxonomic scales; 3) Increasing public scientific literacy by enhancing K-12 education in the sciences at Memorial Junior High in Eagle Pass TX with about 98% Hispanic and 2% Native American students and a high number of English Language Learners and migrants; and 4) Developing a diverse workforce by engaging students from under-represented and marginalized groups into undergraduate intern programs. \r\n\r\nHydrothermal venting of heated, reduced fluids from the seafloor occurs globally at plate tectonic boundaries and mid-plate hotspots and has been the subject of vigorous geological, chemical and biological research.  However, this venting is ultimately transient, leaving behind only the sulfide mineral-rich deposits after the fluid flow stops. This project investigates the organisms living on these lesser studied inactive sulfide features in order to understand their ecology and associations with the mineral substratum.  Recent discoveries indicate that some microbial and animal species inhabiting inactive sulfides are not found elsewhere in the marine environment, suggesting the sulfides serve as a unique habitat, distinct from other seafloor topographic features.  The main project objectives are to characterize the species and functional diversity of the inactive sulfide ecosystem across all three domains of life (eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal), determine which animal species are endemic or predominantly associated with inactive sulfides, and explore the biological and geological characteristics governing those associations. The investigators are conducting field studies between 9-10 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise at sites within the axial summit trough as well as at recently discovered off-axis sites away from modern day venting features. The discovery of this novel community of organisms inhabiting inactive sulfide features at hydrothermal vent fields, fueled by resident chemolithotrophic microorganisms, is likely to change the way we think about the role of these ecosystems in deep-sea biodiversity and productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
