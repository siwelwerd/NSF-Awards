 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The plant cell membrane functions as a platform for communication (signaling) with the outside environment. This membrane constantly changes its molecular composition of lipids (fats) and proteins in response to developmental and environmental signals in a process known as membrane remodeling that is critical for plant adaptation and survival. Sphingolipids are abundant lipids in plant membranes that contribute to development and signaling during stress conditions such as freezing, drought, and pathogen infection. This project will analyze how sphingolipids participate in membrane remodeling and cell to cell communication. Investigating how these processes occur is important to understand how plants can adapt to stressful conditions. This knowledge is relevant for biotechnological advances using plants and will provide insights into membrane trafficking in other organisms. The fellow will receive training in mentoring and science communication practices for diverse audiences. Broader impact activities include developing a science communication workshop for plant scientists on how to share their research with a lay audience.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand how plant sphingolipids affect plasma membrane dynamics and trafficking processes such as endocytosis, endosomal trafficking, and formation of extracellular vesicles.  This project examines Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with increased or reduced levels of sphingolipids to 1) analyze the molecular basis of vesicular trafficking and endosomal sorting of plasma membrane cargo using genetic and molecular approaches coupled with advanced microscopy imaging, and 2) explore the mechanisms for plasma membrane dynamics and formation of extracellular vesicles implementing biochemistry techniques. Training activities include building skillsets in biochemistry and advanced microscopy techniques, such as confocal and electron microscopy, and electron tomography.  Broadening participation efforts include working with plant scientist to find creative ways to communicate their research and to engage a broader audience in scientific topics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
