 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of maps is commonplace in many aspects of daily life given the widespread use of mobile devices for navigation and increased availability of geospatial data on web platforms. It is important to understand how to design maps that communicate information effectively and have high usability. This project studies how map design affects the ability to understand the spaces and places represented in maps via fMRI brain scanning \u2013 a method used to see responses in our brains while looking at maps. This project uses brain scanning to better observe and study how the design of maps affects the spatial decision-making process in our minds. Ultimately, the insight from this research has the potential to change how maps are designed and tailored for different applications. This project will contribute to training of graduate students in geospatial design and cognitive science.\r\n\r\nMap makers and researchers argue that cartographic visual contrast, the measure of how objects on a map stand out, is important for ensuring that maps are easily read and understood. However, there is no consensus on how to designing maps with good contrast. This matter is complicated by different interpretations of visual contrast in map design. This research uses neuroscientific understandings to reframe visual contrast theories by conducting a traditional map design interaction study coupled with an fMRI brain scanning experiment. Participants\u2019 brain activities are observed while they complete map interaction tasks under different visual contrast conditions. Data are analyzed to identify the areas of the brain relevant for different map interaction tasks. The analysis searches for any potential mediating effects resulting from different map visual contrast conditions. The result of this research helps to modernize and anchor an important map design concept within current design science literature. This also research expands what we know about parts of the brain that are important for map interaction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
