 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This 8-week summer program provides mentored research experiences to a diverse group of 10 students per year, who engage in a set of activities designed to build skills and produce research on pressing socio-political questions. A key societal benefit is the production of research that generates new insights into the peaceful conditions, behaviors, and edifices that permit societies to flourish. This objective carries positive implications for national security: key global challenges are declining physical security and growing deficiencies in institutions that deliver effective policies and protect basic freedoms. To meet these challenges, we need to equip researchers with cutting-edge capabilities and we need to produce policy-relevant scientific research. A critical contribution to education is to build students\u2019 interest and skills in the development, interpretation, and communication of rigorous social science research. An important contribution to national welfare is to prepare and support young citizens in the pursuit of careers involving the production, presentation, and consumption of rigorous social science research, especially in ways that advance strong societies and institutions. In addition, the program contributes to building a stronger research community by engaging and creating networks for scholars from minority-serving institutions, teaching institutions, and larger research institutions.\r\n\r\nREU participants are guided through two complementary experiences: a mentored independent research project and collaboration on a faculty affiliate\u2019s project. Students attend skill-building sessions on research design, scientific inference, data analysis, professionalization, research communication, faculty research presentations, and career panels. The site engages collaborating partners at minority-serving institutions universities, local colleges, and professional organizations to amplify awareness of the program and recruit a wide range of participants. The site will generate new discoveries on how accountability, behavior, and conflict shape democratic politics. Topics include contentious politics, governance failings and their consequences, political polarization, and responsiveness in government institutions. The REU site will (1) provide mentored research opportunities to a diverse group of students; (2) train faculty and student mentors; (3) equip students with research skills, networks, and other resources for career development; (4) elevate the visibility and voices of individuals from under-represented groups; (5) connect with and include faculty from minority-serving institutions and a diverse network of researchers; and (6) provide students with the tools to effectively communicate research findings to academic and non-academic audiences. The site will provide mentored research experiences on topics related to accountability, behavior, and conflict in democratic politics; build interest, skillsets, and knowledge at the cutting edge of social science research; and prepare and support students entering career paths that involve the production, presentation, and informed consumption of scientific research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
