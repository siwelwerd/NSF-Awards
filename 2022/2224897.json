 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ribose 2'-hydroxyl group (2'-OH) is the key chemical difference between RNA and DNA. Their divergent characteristics, including structure, stability, function and activity, can be attributed to various degrees to the presence of the 2'-OH in RNA and its absence in DNA. The 2'-OH affects the sugar conformational equilibrium and thereby the geometry of paired RNA strands, and ultimately the much-expanded 3D fold-space of RNA compared to DNA. The 2'-OH is the only hydrogen bond donor in the nucleic acid backbone and results in increased RNA hydration and thermodynamic stability relative to DNA. Moreover, the 2'-OH acts as nucleophile in RNA splicing reactions and ribozyme-catalyzed phosphodiester cleavage. Structural biology has ignored the 2'-OH hydrogen/orientation, owing to technical limitations of X-ray crystallography (XC) and challenges to solution studies such as rapid exchange. Neutron crystallography (NC) reveals the locations of hydrogen atoms (2H, deuterium or D) in biomacromolecules. In the project joint cryo-NC/XC will be used on several RNA targets to assess: (i) The importance of the 2'-OH in RNA\u2019s expansive fold space, (ii) How binding proteins might influence 2'-OH orientation to sculpt the RNA backbone, and (iii) Differences in 2'- and 3'-OH orientations in 5'-3' and 5'-2' linked RNAs, respectively, that might explain the latter\u2019s demise in nature. The rigorous, combined NC/XC approach will produce improved models of water structure and a better understanding of nucleic acid structure, function and interactions with binding proteins. The project work will ultimately enable refined theoretical treatments of macromolecules and hydration, e.g., by molecular dynamics simulations. Structural refinements and data science aspects of this research, including PDB searches and large-scale analysis of pucker modes provide ideal projects for high-school students/undergraduates as part of Vanderbilt\u2019s Aspirnaut program.\r\n\r\nNeutron crystallography (NC) reveals the locations of hydrogen atoms (2H, deuterium or D) in biomacromolecules. Conversely, X-ray crystallography (XC) cannot pinpoint H atoms even at high resolution. Cryo NC also establishes the orientations of first- and higher-shell D2O. However, NC research has remained high-risk/-impact, owing to the need for large crystals, perdeuterated samples and limited access to beamlines. Recently the PI applied cryo NC for the first time to an RNA structure using state-of the-art instrumentation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Cryo NC uncovered roles of ribose hydroxyls (2'-OHs) in stabilizing non-canonical backbone geometries, a structural correlation between 2'-OH orientation and sugar pucker, and a 6:1 preference of the 2'-OH to act as H-bond donor rather than acceptor. These insights lead to hypotheses in regard to: (i) The importance of the 2'-OH moiety in RNA\u2019s expanded fold space relative to DNA (ii) How binding proteins might influence 2'-OH orientation and flip the ribose pucker to sculpt the RNA backbone geometry, and (iii) Differences in 2'- and 3'-OH orientations in 5'-3' and 5'-2' linked RNAs, respectively, that may explain the latter\u2019s demise in nature. Water in living systems is omnipresent and is involved in governing folding, geometry, stability, dynamics, function and interactions of proteins and nucleic acids. The rigorous cryo NC/XC approach will produce improved models of water structure, with implications for our understanding of nucleic acid structure, function and interactions with binding proteins. The project work will ultimately enable refined theoretical treatments of macromolecules and hydration by QM-MM and MD simulations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
