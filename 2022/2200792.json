 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MSU Data Machine addresses the exponential growth of large and complex datasets in many fields of study, particularly those where computing has not been widely used or where the research and teaching approaches needed to work with \u201cbig data\u201d, which present a different set of computing requirements than in traditional high performance computing.  The Data Machine facilitates data-intensive research by having computing nodes with large amounts of memory, a high speed file system, graphics processing units that are optimized for machine learning and artificial intelligence-based analysis techniques, and a high speed file system.  It also includes software, usage policies, and training that makes it easy for users to interactively analyze and visualize their data. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on four specific research areas - in the areas of microbial genomics, social system modeling, spatial and community ecology, and data-driven turbulence modeling - however, the Data Machine broadly enables MSU\u2019s research community to pursue data-intensive research projects by lowering barriers to engaging with these types of resources.  The project also provides a valuable computational resource to the nation via the Open Science Grid and MSU\u2019s NSF-funded Science DMZ project, advancing research in a wide spectrum of areas.  Furthermore, MSU undergraduate and graduate students are participating in the deployment and administration of the Data Machine as well as using it for research and educational activities, contributing to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce and promoting the advancement of under-represented groups in computational and data science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
