 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to develop a viable and scalable process to manufacture a bamboo-based strand composite for application in low-cost roofing globally.  This project develops a new production process for exterior-grade natural fiber composite building products, derived from a highly renewable resource, bamboo, through public-private partnership.  The resulting roofing product will help protect users from extreme heat by passively cooling and reducing indoor temperatures. In addition, this solution can be used to create value-added energy-efficient building products from highly renewable natural fiber waste. The innovation holds immense potential to replace harmful and hazardous materials, including asbestos, in many regions of the world, store captured carbon into long-lifecycle products, and reduce heating and cooling energy use.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will: (i) refine the design of the 3D panel geometry used to make commercial-size panels with improved load-carrying capacity and constructability; (ii) improve the bamboo-stranding process, evaluate a bio-based adhesive system, impart fire-retardance, enhance panel durability, manufacture panels using the new geometry, and evaluate performance; and (iii) demonstrate and evaluate panel use as a roofing material through field tests and the versatility of the corrugated panel in interior and exterior energy-efficient building products. This research will advance the field of natural fiber composites by addressing challenges of long-term construction applications that can withstand hot and humid climates, including moisture resistance, biodegradation, and effective binders for functionality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
