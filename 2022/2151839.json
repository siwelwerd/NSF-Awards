 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need to recruit and train high school mathematics teachers in rural areas. In partnership with Southwestern Community College (SCC) and the Macon County, Swain County, and Jackson County public school districts, Western Carolina University (WCU) will work toward the collaborative development of a cohort-based, prospective teacher pipeline. The project intends to establish a recruitment and support plan and determine barriers for prospective teachers. Additionally, the project will identify early field experiences through SCC and mentoring and networking opportunities through the Smoky Mountain Math Teachers\u2019 Circle (SMMTC). By focusing on the three needs of infrastructure, collaboration, and retention, the project intends to build capacity to help address the deficit of secondary mathematics teachers.\r\n\r\nThe project has the following goals: (1) establish a plan for the recruitment and support of a diverse pool of talented undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees with an interest in becoming high-school mathematics teachers in Western North Carolina (WNC);  (2) identify the barriers to student success in Secondary Mathematics Education in WNC; (3) establish various options for early field experiences through existing programs at SCC, and (4) establish mentoring and networking opportunities through involvement of students with the SMMTC. Data collection will include surveys of in-service teachers, alumni, school counselors, and current STEM majors regarding interest in and barriers to teaching secondary mathematics in WNC. A Local Educational Agency focus group, a Community College Advisory Board, an Educational Enrichment Programs Advisory Board, and the SMMTC leadership will help the project meet its goals. As a result of this project, future STEM majors could benefit from intentionally streamlined transfer options, designed instructional bridges, and new regional partnerships. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
