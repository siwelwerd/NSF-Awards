 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project investigates the interaction between the logical reasoning machinery inside the human brain (semantics) and the linguistic context of conversation (pragmatics). The project involves detailed fieldwork on four diverse, understudied languages that will uncover theoretical and typological universals in semantics and pragmatics and their interaction. The investigation focuses on the usage and interpretation of \"discourse particles,\" which are linguistic units (often small function words in a sentence) that track and convey various contextual aspects of interpersonal conversations. This is an underexplored area of research with great potential to address fundamental questions about how human languages express reasoning, inferences, beliefs, and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis project promotes a data-theory-typology triad by studying the empirical, theoretical, and typological underpinnings of discourse competence through the lens of discourse particles with a three-pronged focus: modal discourse particles and their complements; interaction of discourse particles with tense, aspect, mood; discourse particles and non-canonical speech acts. In addition to research output, results will include the creation of standardized open-source materials for theory-oriented semantic/pragmatic fieldwork that can be used for any language; training of graduate and undergraduate students in modern methodologies informed by empirical and theoretical diversity in a fieldwork lab; and recruitment and involvement of native speaker and community/heritage linguists from groups historically minoritized in academia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
