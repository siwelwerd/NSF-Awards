 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next triennial international conference in the series Foundations of Computational Mathematics, FoCM 2023, will be hosted at the Sorbonne University in Paris, France, June 12\u201321, 2023. The Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) conferences aim to be a main vehicle in the exploration of the broad interface between mathematics and contemporary computation, a subject area of importance both intellectually and for practical applications. It is expected that about 500 researchers will attend the conference from around the world, and about a third of them will be from the US. This project will partially cover travel and lodging costs for a diverse group of US researchers attending the conference. The majority of the funds will be distributed on a competitive basis to junior US participants, including graduate students, postdocs, and tenure track faculty.\r\n\r\nThe conference will follow the format of former FoCM conferences: plenary lectures in the mornings and theme-centered parallel workshops in the afternoons. Each workshop extends over three days, and the conference will consist of three periods, each period featuring 7 mathematically diverse but interconnected workshops, with 21 workshops in total. These activities combined with poster sessions and informal interactions among participants all synthesize forefront research with mentoring and training opportunities for young participants, helping them develop networks that include the world\u2019s leading researchers. A number of themes connect the diverse workshop topics, such as learning from computation to automate, adapt and optimize the computational process which by itself becomes an analysis tool, ties from homotopy methods used in computational algebraic geometry for systems of algebraic equations and interior point methods in continuous optimization to numerical methods for differential equations and aspects of differential geometry, machine learning and signal processing cast as very large and challenging convex optimization problems, common themes among symbolic algorithms used for the solution of algebraic and differential equations, and relationships between decidability and tractability in real/complex arithmetic computational models and the Turing machine models considered in the context of combinatorics and intractability as well as discrete optimization.  More information about the FoCM 2023 conference can be found at https://focm2023.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
