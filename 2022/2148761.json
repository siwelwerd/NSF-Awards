 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Washington, located in Seattle, WA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks each summer from 2022- 2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Participants will gain valuable knowledge in an area of research that has significant and growing global impact on the quality of life. Assessment of the program will be done using the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe scientific theme will focus on the emerging domain of neural engineering. This research area encompasses the development of concepts and devices used to assist, understand, and interact with neural systems. Because neural engineering is an interdisciplinary topic, students will be assigned to laboratories in several departments including Bioengineering, Biology, Physiology and Biophysics, Psychology, Rehabilitation Medicine, Computer Sciences and Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. In addition to laboratory work, students will participate in a communications course and workshops to improve their presentation and writing skills. All REU participants will complete a Responsible Conduct of Research Training including discussions about the ethical conduct of research. A special workshop will be provided about how ethical issues might arise in the field of sensorimotor neural engineering. Talented undergraduates, especially those from under-represented groups and who have completed their freshman and sophomore years, are encouraged to apply. The selection of students is based on the quality of the students' written materials in their application, letters of recommendation and academic record.  More information about the program is available by visiting https://centerforneurotech.uw.edu/content/research-experience-undergraduates, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Eric H. Chudler at chudler@uw.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Rajesh Rao at rao@cs.washington.edu). This award is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE Program in partnership with the NSF REU Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
