 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supporting participation by students and early-career researchers in the inaugural Frontiers in Hydrology Meeting to be held in June 19-24, 2022, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Frontiers in Hydrology Meeting will convene the broad water science community and advance the field of hydrologic science. The meeting is being jointly held by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Hydrology Section and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc (CUAHSI). The meeting will bring together the water community to share findings, develop new collaborations, network, and explore connections between water issues and the human experience. The meeting brings together hydrologists, engineers, social scientists, students, journalists, policymakers, educators, urban planners, natural disaster professionals and others to better understand water and the critical role it plays, in conjunction with the Earth environment, in preserving a viable future. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will focus on topics of environmental justice and equity, managing scarce resources, projecting future water availability and quality, and simulating complex systems. These broad-based, critical topics will allow for extensive discussions on the future of hydrologic systems in different areas of the globe and bring in multiple affected audiences. This grant will support participation by a diverse community of students and early-career researchers. The program will be designed to include mentoring and networking opportunities. \r\n\r\nThis conference provides an opportunity for greater participation from communities underrepresented in the field of hydrology, especially those in the Caribbean and Latin America, as the conference will be held physically in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It will also offer an opportunity for students and early-career scientists to build their professional networks and establish new collaborations. Several local field trips and other projects will provide opportunities for engagement between meeting participants and local communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
