 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drug development and assessment present major challenges, in particular: 1) In the early stages of drug discovery, it is costly and time-consuming to screen thousands of possible drugs. 2) When healthcare providers use the drug for treatment, it is highly important to assess their efficacy as well as potential adverse effects. Novel computational approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), present solutions not only for drug design but also for personalized treatments. The Center for Data-Driven Drug Development and Treatment Assessment (DATA), through collaboration with its industry partners, intends to promote such computational solutions within precompetitive research.\r\n\r\nIn recent years AI and ML methods have impacted many aspects of society; DATA will develop and apply novel AI/ML methods for several aspects of drug design and assessment such as screening/detecting interactions between drugs and targets, and treatment customization considering preexisting conditions. DATA\u2019s mathematical algorithms and methodologies can result in tools and solutions to address major obstacles throughout the lifecycle of drug design and treatment monitoring. The Center also develops large databases by integrating and curating new/existing public and proprietary healthcare/pharmaceutical datasets, allowing new resources for modeling, development, and assessment of new drugs.\r\n\r\nDATA will develop programs to educate the next generation of data scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. DATA will form new collaborations beyond academia to translate data science applications into impactful products/services, thereby reducing drug development costs while optimizing treatments and improving overall patient health. This in turn reduces the financial/societal burden on patients and providers alike. DATA will enable direct interactions between trainees and pharmaceutical/healthcare industry leaders, providing trainees with invaluable insight into real-world needs. DATA will address the urgent need for additional graduates with combined expertise in data science, drug design, and treatment assessment by directly training this future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe data integration, curation and storage processes are intended to continue beyond the scope and duration of the Phase I (and Phase II, if applicable). DATA intends to continue collecting, curating, integrating, and pre-processing databases shared by the current and future members of DATA as well as publicly available databases. A subset of these integrated databases, some of which will be encrypted through our Fully Homomorphic Encryption approach, can be shared with external entities under the guidelines set by the Center\u2019s bylaws. Databases and software tools will be shared by the partners through a dedicated and secure website with documentation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
