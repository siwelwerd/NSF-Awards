 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Plastics derived from petroleum are ubiquitous in our society, comprising affordable packaging, components of automobiles, computers, building materials, medical devices, etc. However, because of their durability and stability, and their low level of recycling, plastic pollution in the environment and oceans has become a major societal, worldwide problem. The NSF Partnership for Research and Education in Chemistry\u2012Sustainable Polymers (PREC-SP) will embrace a holistic approach to developing fundamental knowledge and applications of sustainable polymers to meet societal needs. Successful implementation of the proposed work will result in he PREC-SP faculty and students conducting collaborative research with faculty and students of the existing NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers (CSP), as Phase II Center for Chemical Innovation (CCI), supported by the Division of Chemistry (CHE). This partnership has the potential to synergistically combine their transformative work of how plastics are made, unmade, and remade through innovative research and engaging education. The multi-institutional, collaborative research projects that will be the backbone of this PREC-SP/CSP partnership include: (1) development and study of porous crystalline framework catalysts for sustainable biomass valorization to polymer feedstocks; (2) preparation, characterization, processing, and biodegradation of PLA (polylactic acid) and PHB (polyhydroxybutyrate) nanocomposite material that are reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals; (3) synthesis of sustainable block copolymers, functional polymers, and hairy nanoparticles via novel polymerization techniques.\r\n   \r\nThe PREC-SP has the potential to expand the diversity of researchers supporting the development of sustainable polymers. Successful implementation will increase education and research opportunities through research experiences for undergraduates, faculty and student exchanges, joint PREC-SP/CSP workshops & seminars, research group meetings, and other practices for professional growth. These opportunities could significantly increase the recruitment, retention, degree completion, of African Americans who enroll in and complete graduate degrees in the chemical sciences, key elements of viable pipeline. A successful partnership will build a sustainable pathway for underrepresented minority students into the professional workforce and higher education research and development positions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
