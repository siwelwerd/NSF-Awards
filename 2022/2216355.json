 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. New York University is upgrading the electronics of a X-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer to include pulsed EPR equipped with Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) detection to support the research of Professor Claudia Avalos and colleagues Bart E. Kahr and Stephanie Lee.  This instrument facilitates research in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, and material science. The proposed instrument combines three techniques: electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP). An EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of short-lived, highly reactive species involved in important chemical and biochemical processes. NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. In general, ODNP uses microwave radiation to increase NMR detection sensitivity by up to two orders of magnitude. This combined instrument allows simultaneous detection of EPR and amplified NMR signals for the thorough characterization of the properties of molecular systems. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in multiple departments at New York University as well as regional institutions in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nThe award of the EPR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially to investigate molecular mechanisms of proteins, cells, and inorganic samples. The instrument impacts research focused on studying optically generated spin polarization in chromophore radical systems, charge transport in twisted organic semiconductor crystals, and understanding impurity doping in semiconductor nanocrystals.  It also assists in the in situ characterization of paramagnetic intermediates in nickel-catalyzed reactions. Other investigations include the determination of mechanisms of membrane protein transporters, structural characterization of protein and protein assemblies, and to detect conformational changes in disordered proteins. The instrument further impacts the study of radical species on block copolymers, nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond for quantum information sensing and spin hyperpolarization, and optically generated spin polarization for magnetic resonance imaging. The research projects to be enabled by the instrument could lead to impacts in the fields of quantum science and energy storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
