 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a conference on microlocal analysis, harmonic analysis, and inverse problems, which will take place August 15-17, 2022 at the University of Rochester. These three research areas have many points of intersection and have each seen tremendous progress in recent decades. Furthermore, research in these areas has led to advances in applied subjects such as diffuse and X-ray tomography, non-invasive imaging, and cloaking technology. The purpose of the conference is to bring together mathematicians working at the borders between these three research areas, to spur the cross-fertilization of ideas and generate new directions for the global research agenda. The conference also includes specific activities geared towards early-career mathematicians, and aims to provide such researchers with valuable experiences to help further their professional careers.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the workshop is to bring together an international group of experts in three research areas: microlocal analysis, inverse problems, and harmonic analysis. A variety of topics are expected to receive prominent attention during the meeting. These include eigenfunction bounds for Laplace-Beltrami operators on Riemannian manifolds, regularity of Radon transform operators, Falconer\u2019s distance set conjecture and some of its more recent generalizations, and connections between Fourier integral operators, inverse problems, and integral geometry. The conference program includes specific activities intended to promote a robust and informative dialogue among researchers from the three focus research areas, as well as opportunities for the professional development of junior researchers. \r\n\r\nhttps://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/iosevich/allanconferencewebsite.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
