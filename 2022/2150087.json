 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThis REU Site award to Florida A&M University, located in Tallahassee, FL, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022 - 2024. It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. The REU participants will gain research experience in cutting-edge technologies to encourage pursuit of advanced degrees and careers in STEM. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Students will be encouraged to form networks critical to their development as scientists. \r\n\r\nThis REU program focuses on systems biology research, integrating Omics Technologies and Data Science, to understand interactions in a living system. A multidisciplinary faculty team from biology, chemistry, and computer science will serve as mentors. Examples of research projects for REU students include investigations that 1) Determine molecular responses for cross-tolerance mechanism in the host using both abiotic and biotic factors; 2) Unravel the disease pathways and networks in model organisms, and 3) Develop computational models to predict plant-host interactions. This program will train students on the responsible conduct of research and laboratory biosafety. Recruitment of students will utilize hard copy and digital-based advertising. Students will be selected based on their academic record, faculty recommendations, and research interest. Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their area of study and the lasting influence of the research experience. Assessment of the program will be done through the Student Assessment of Learning Goals (SALG URSSA https://salgsite.net). More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.famu.edu/index.cfm? or by contacting the PI, Dr. Ramesh Katam (Ramesh.katam@famu.edu; 850-559-3134) or the co-PI, Dr. Virginia Gottschalk, (gladiatrx3@gmail.com) 850-561-2750).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
