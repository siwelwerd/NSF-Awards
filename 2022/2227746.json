 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of the 43rd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. The conference will be held in San Diego, California. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and programming systems research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
