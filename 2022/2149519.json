 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice cores provide valuable records of past climate such as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses and unmatched evidence of past abrupt climate change. Key to understanding past climate changes are the measurements of annual layers that are used to determine the age of the ice, and the timing and pace of major climate events. The current measurement limit for annual layers in ice cores is at the centimeter scale. This project aims to improve the depth resolution of measurements of the chemical impurities in ice using measurements such as electrical conductivity, hyperspectral imaging, major elements measured with laser ablation, and ice grain properties. This will advance understanding of the preservation and layering in ice cores and improve the accuracy and length of annual timescales for existing ice cores.\r\n\r\nMost of the past time preserved in an ice core is near the bed where the layers have been thinned to only a fraction of their original thickness. Interpreting highly compressed portions of ice cores is increasingly important as projects target climate records in basal ice, and old ice recovered from blue-ice areas. This project will integrate precisely co-registered electrical conductivity measurements, hyperspectral imaging, laser ablation mass spectrometer measurements of impurities, and ice physical properties to investigate sub-centimeter chemical and physical variations in polar ice. Critical to resolving thin ice layers is understanding the across-core variations that may obscure or distort the vertical layering. Analyses will be focused on samples from the WDC-06A (WAIS Divide), SPC-14 (South Pole), and GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) ice cores that have well-established seasonal cycles that yielded benchmark timescales, as well a large-diameter ice core from the Allan Hills blue ice area. This work will develop state-of-the-art instrumentation and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data handling workflow at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility available to the community both to enhance understanding of existing ice cores, and for use in future projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
