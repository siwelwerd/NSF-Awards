 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to create and study an Equitable and Interactive Mathematical Modeling (EIM2) program that positions students as decision makers in their own learning. Despite the value of connecting students\u2019 life experiences with their mathematical learning, the practical implementation of this strategy has proven challenging in a classroom setting. EIM2 addresses this issue by supporting students to engage in equitable mathematical modeling, a process of using mathematics to analyze and quantify scenarios through a lens of equity. The EIM2 program involves collaborations with sixth and seventh grade students, a professional learning community series with their mathematics teachers, and the creation of the dynamic, online platform that hosts EIM2 modules. The EIM2 dynamic online platform allows students to easily select scenarios based on their interests; experience the scenarios with visuals and animations; and compare, synthesize, and refine their mathematical ideas.\r\n\r\nThe program development will be guided by design principles and hypothesized learning processes that support students\u2019 cultural competence, their evaluations of multiple mathematical solutions, and their mathematical identity development. Using multi-tier design-based research and a mixed-methods approach, the EIM2 program will be continuously evaluated and refined through multiple iterations to ensure usability and efficacy. Over the four-year project span, this project will (1) explore the nature and impact of the EIM2 program, assessing how it promotes a shared vision for the learning of all students, including racially and ethnically minoritized students, in classroom settings; (2) examine whether and how students\u2019 engagement in EIM2 supports their achievement and identity development in mathematics; and (3) understand how teachers enact EIM2 and whether they change their attitudes toward modeling over time and across contexts. The proposed project fills a theoretical gap related to scalable design models for interactive mathematical modeling curricula that are culturally sustaining for students. Our model improves upon current practices of mathematical modeling by transforming existing curricula to reflect students\u2019 lived experiences and to foster their active learning, leveraging the interactive nature of digital curricula. Our proposed work has the potential to be transformative for STEM education through the co-creation of asset-based instructional materials built on a deep understanding of students, which can be applicable for other STEM education fields of study.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
