 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project seeks to provide STEM students at Hampton University with education and training in modern principles and techniques of microbial genomics by infusing microbiology and genomics into the university STEM curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to 1) build computational infrastructure that focuses on experiential learning with hands-on instruction in techniques and methodologies related to microbial genomics; 2) bridge three sequential courses via extended course-based undergraduate research experiences (eCURE) where students will contribute meaningful data; 3) empower the next generation of scientists in microbial genomics and to support this population of students as they enter the STEM workforce; 4) provide faculty professional development to integrate current trends in undergraduate teaching; and 5) introduce undergraduate students to notable African American (and other underrepresented) scientists through a dedicated seminar series. Of note, the integration of microbial enhancements, physiology and genomics via extended course-based undergraduate research experiences (eCURE) into the undergraduate STEM curriculum will better prepare undergraduates, primarily African American students, for graduate study and the STEM workforce. The findings from this project will serve as a model for other Historically Black Colleges and Universities and 4-year institutions that seek to educate and maintain a diverse STEM workforce in microbial genomics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
