 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Strengthening Traineeships and Research Opportunities for Next Generation Geoscientists (STRONG) project will provide training for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) and allied early career faculty on how to strengthen traineeship and research opportunities for next generation geoscientists from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Ten BIPOC and allied Geoscience Faculty of the Future (GEOFFs) will participate in training in preparation to mentor and train MSI STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) students to thrive in geoscience graduate programs at research-intensive universities. MSI STEM students thriving and not just being retained in graduate programs will lead to more of these students having healthy mindsets about pursuing research careers in support of the national interest of a diverse geoscience workforce. The project seeks to address the issues of equitable pathways to graduate geoscience programs for MSI STEM students, the mindset of faculty regarding the quality of MSI STEM students for research assistantships, and the well-being and preparedness of BIPOC and allied early career faculty to persist in the academy to mentor and train MSI STEM students.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to close the knowledge gap of how to have MSI STEM students and BIPOC and allied early career geoscience faculty and researchers thrive in geoscience departments at research intensive universities. The method will involve training of early career faculty in how to be inclusive and intentional in their identification of MSI STEM students for graduate research work, how to be intentional in their training of the students to be collaborators on their research, and how to present inclusive curriculum in associated classroom activities. Geoscience faculty of the future (GEOFF) will be trained by experienced geoscience faculty who serve as trainers with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. A summer research training experience (RTX) prepared by and implemented by the early career faculty for the ten MSI STEM students will serve as a field experience for the early career faculty to practice their research collaboration training and mentoring. Each GEOFF participant will contribute their expertise to the development and delivery of training modules. GEOFF will support each other up to, during, and after the practicum via participation in a research coordination network and participation on a committee for lessons on equitable admissions and retention in graduate programs. Training BIPOC and allied early career faculty to be inclusive geoscience leaders has the potential to imbed inclusive geoscience leadership into departments across the country and to make inclusion business-as-usual over the 20 to 30 years of the careers of the inclusive leaders. We expect that other faculty in the departments of the GEOFFs observing the success of MSI STEM students in contributing to research will develop more favorable mindsets of the ability of MSI STEM majors to contribute to their lab and complete a rigorous graduate program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
