 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Union College Mathematics Conference will take place June 3-5, 2022, on the Union College campus in Schenectady, NY.  This conference has been held in various forms since the 1970s, approximately every 2-3 years. The conference has made a significant impact on the research productivity of the Hudson Valley region and beyond. The conference will create a unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary research among the various fields represented at the conference. The award will support the participation of mathematicians who are in the early stages of their careers and/or are members of historically underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. \r\n \r\nThe conference will feature five parallel sessions in Algebraic Topology, Applied Topology and Geometry, Differential Geometry and Geometric Analysis, Rings and Algebras, and Stochastic Analysis and Applications. In addition, there will be five featured talks (including four plenary) on recent work in these fields, a networking opportunity for those who have been involved with or are interested in the Association for Women in Mathematics' research communities, and many opportunities for interaction among participants. The parallel sessions will provide researchers with the chance to learn of recent developments in their fields and to share their own work with an audience of specialists, while the plenary talks have the potential to foster the creation of entirely new fields by exposing participants to groundbreaking work outside of their own areas of expertise. The conference website is maintained at: http://www.math.union.edu/~marianop/UnionConference2022/UCMC2022index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
