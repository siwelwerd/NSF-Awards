 "awd_abstract_narration": "American banking has long denied credit to borrowers in poor and marginalized communities. Yet that system contains a striking variety of lending organizations, ranging from global corporate behemoths to community banks, credit unions and community development institutions, that embrace very different business models missions and values, and that relate to borrowers and communities, including poor and traditionally marginalized minority ones, in very different ways. This project analyzes that organizational variety and its impact in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to determine how differences in lending organizations and the ecologies or mixes of lenders that populate banking markets shape\u2013and might enhance\u2014access to credit for small business in poor and non-white communities. Ideally suited for this study, the PPP was a federal government program that worked though the nations\u2019 existing lenders to issue nearly 12 million loans to businesses to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic, and produced detailed data on where and to whom lenders lent.\r\n\r\nTo address the impact of lender organizational form and bank market ecologies on credit flows, this project combines interviews of lenders and borrowers with multi-level quantitative analyses of a new data set on all PPP loans that links: a) data on lending by seven lender types and socio-economic conditions in 32,000 communities, with b) data on the organizational compositions of 625 regional banking markets that served those communities. These analyses contribute broadly to understanding how organization shapes inequality, while extending organizational ecology and institutional research on organizational form and complexity to new outcomes.  They address a key gap in our knowledge of class and ethno-racial divides in banking and credit, integrating work in organizational studies, economic sociology and political economy on bank organization, banking systems and their economic impacts with research in sociology, law and allied fields, which extensively analyzes banking and credit as sites of discrimination and segregation, but commonly sets organizational variety in banking aside (or focus on large banks) to document broader systemic tendencies.  And by identifying possibilities for greater inclusivity within American banking\u2014and in government programs that work though that system \u2013 this project highlights new avenues for reform, including building the capacities of lenders that engage traditionally marginalized communities and altering mixes of institutions in regional markets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To achieve these goals, the PIs and undergraduate assistants: 1) constructed and quantitively analyzed new census-, zip code-, and congressional district-level data sets on lender institutions, loans, socio-economic conditions and political factors; and 2) constructed and qualitatively analyzed publicly available information and data from 90 interviews with PPP borrowers and lenders, advocacy groups, lender associations, Congressional staff, local leaders, and others.<br /><br />The research generated three main findings. First, there was more diversity among banking enterprises in the US than generally recognized, and striking differences across lender types in how they channeled credit to or away from poor and minority communities. Overall, giant bank corporations, regional commercial banks, community banks, credit unions and farm credit associations were more likely to avoid lending to small businesses in communities that were high poverty or majority non-white than otherwise, and made fewer loans on average to such communities if they issued any loans there. In contrast, community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and financial technology lenders (Fintechs) were more likely to lend to poor or non-white communities than otherwise, and made more loans to those communities than low poverty or majority white ones. &nbsp;<br /><br />Second, the PPP pivoted from a markedly exclusive to a likewise inclusive allocation of loans. Loans first flowed overwhelmingly to larger firms in more affluent white areas, yet then flowed to smaller firms in poorer and minority communities, driving coverage there to parity with low poverty and white places. Moreover, this pivot was based in interactions over time between the PPP&rsquo;s policy architectures, the politics and feedback processes they activated, and lenders&rsquo; shifting organizational compositions and practices. The pivot resulted most proximally from politics and targeted policy reforms that promoted inclusive lenders and that nudged lenders of all types to become more inclusive. Reforms let CDFIs and Fintechs issue nearly three million loans in the PPP&rsquo;s last round (nearly half that round&rsquo;s total), and moved mainstream banks from aversion toward neutrality in engaging poor and minority communities.
