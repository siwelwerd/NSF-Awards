This short course will bring a focused perspective to this area, with emphasis on physical properties and fundamental physics of polymers and how they may be designed with consideration of sustainability goals and metrics. Towards this goal, researchers will come together from cross-disciplinary areas, including polymer physics, polymer chemistry, and materials science, and address the full life cycle of polymers, from sustainable origins to design for ease of end-of-life handling and re-use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
