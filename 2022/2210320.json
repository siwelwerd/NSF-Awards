 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control and optimization need to be conducted simultaneously in numerous applications: smart grids, transportation networks, cooperative robotics, healthcare, and other autonomous systems interacting via wireless or physically-linked communications. These two tasks are typically treated distinctly, approached by independent designs. As a result, the two tasks interfere with one another and require performance compromises in at least of the two. For instance, optimality is obtained, but slowly, or convergence is rapid, but to suboptimal motions. A deep integration of control and optimization holds great promise. The integration is made difficult by the surge in complexity of contemporary control systems, reflected in the dynamic order, model uncertainty, and unreliable networking. The key challenge for concurrently running the mutually interfering optimization and control is the stability of the overall system or, if stability is ensured, the convergence rate. The control-optimization interference has been the hallmark of both classical adaptive control (controller-estimator interference) and extremum seeking (optimizer-controller interference), which are special cases of concurrent control and optimization. This project will advance the mathematical foundations of distributed optimization-based control and develop new tools and methods for real-time distributed optimization-based control design of large-scale and nonlinear uncertain systems. The methodology will be validated by means of cooperative robotic networks.\r\n\r\nThe tools developed in this project, for real-time distributed optimization-based control algorithms for large-scale nonlinear systems with uncertainties, are of transformative nature. The algorithms designed will be applicable to heretofore intractable large-scale systems, including uncertain networked nonlinear systems and robotic networks described by Euler-Lagrange equations.  To de-conflict the entanglement of optimization and control, the PIs pursue three research tasks: (1) the synthesis of distributed optimization algorithms that are robust to uncertainties, (2) the design of tracking controllers for each local system to follow in real time the desired output that aims to globally minimize certain global cost, and (3) the integration of optimization and control algorithms for global convergence of optimization algorithms and stability of the closed-loop network. The project builds on the PIs\u2019 foundational contributions in nonlinear small-gain theory, fortified uncertainty-attenuating controllers and estimators for modular adaptive control design, and on their complementary skillsets in learning-based control and in real-time optimization by extremum seeking. The deliverable is a controller-optimizer co-design with a greatly enlarged applicability, in terms of the generality of the nonlinear plants and the achieved robustness and adaptivity, as compared to current methods which rely on linearly-bounded interactions among the modules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
