 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the adoption and perceived benefit of hearing aids using an improved virtual reality (VR) fitting process. Although many people may benefit from using hearing aids, the majority of potential patients choose not to purchase any devices. The different reasons suggested for not using hearing aids include negative stigma, cost, and little to no perceived benefit. The current process of fitting hearing aids is indirect, requiring multiple visits to the clinic. Users typically are fit with hearing aids, sent out to use them for a few weeks, and then asked return to the clinic for adjustments. As such, the process is time consuming to tune a device properly, and it is hard to know if the final tuning is what is best for a specific patient. The proposed virtual reality (VR) software may enable direct, real-time feedback about hearing aid fitting in a controlled clinical environment with a trained audiologist. Patients may be more involved in the hearing aid tuning process, enabling them to directly perceive the benefit of wearing hearing aids. With increased hearing aid adoption, better social engagement may potentially lower the rates of cognitive decline and depression, known comorbidities with hearing loss.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a virtual reality (VR) software to improve the fitting process for hearing aids within audiology clinics. The proposed technology uses an algorithm that enables a highly accurate virtual acoustic rendering of listening with and without hearing aids in realistic sound fields. Existing virtual acoustic algorithms have inaccuracies at higher frequencies, where hearing loss is most common. These inaccuracies make developing VR demonstrations of hearing aids difficult for complex, realistic sound fields. The proposed algorithm is designed to work well at all frequencies, so it may be accurately applied to virtual rendering of listening with hearing aids. The VR software developed for this project simulates both a listener\u2019s natural hearing, without hearing aids, and a listener\u2019s aided hearing, while wearing hearing aids. As such, this software seeks to allow a listener to directly compare their current hearing with the experience of wearing a hearing aid. The proposed technology uses devices currently on the market that are compatible with current hearing aid fitting processes and software used in audiology clinics. The proposed software also may be scaled to work with any hearing aid capable of low-latency streaming, expanding its compatibility across different devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite the benefits provided by more options, as the customer it also creates a large amount of confusion. Should I buy a prescription hearing aid, programmed by an audiologist for upwards of $5,000? Or should I get an over-the-counter option, programmed with a phone for around $800? Or could I even use my AirPods that I already own as hearing aids, and what would the difference be compared to a traditional, purpose-built hearing aid? The current state of the hearing aid market is highly confusing for the customer, making it very difficult to navigate.</p>\r\n<p>This project aimed to investigate the commercial viability of immersive audio-visual demonstrations of hearing aids, to let potential hearing aid purchasers directly listen to the benefits that a hearing aid can provide them in the real-world situations where they are experiencing hearing difficulty. With the app deployed to either a virtual reality headset or on a standard touch-screen tablet, listeners can virtually travel to a noisy restaurant, an outdoor park, or even just around the house to hear how a hearing aid could benefit them. As well, the system lets a user compare different brands or types of devices, to help a customer select the device that is best for them and also within their budgetary constraints. Our technology is currently being developed as an android-based app and implemented within audiology clinics, and in the future, we hope to also bring a similar experience to a web-based platform.</p>\r\n<p>From this project, an accurate, realistic way of virtually recreating hearing aid listening conditions was developed, creating significant intellectual merit. Our product experience is much more than listening to a simple, audio-only, static recording of a pair of hearing aids. During a demonstration, you can look around the environment, rotating your head in real-time, and both the audio and video in the demonstration will update just as if you had rotated your head in that same scenario. It also allows for listening to hearing aids programmed for different types of hearing loss, letting a customer have an experience personalized to their specific type of hearing loss. Up until now, no solution existed that lets a user quickly and efficiently compare multiple devices, programmed for their hearing loss, without purchasing multiple devices, having them programmed, taking them out in the real world to try them out, and processing multiple returns. Our demo is a seamless, quick, and easy way to make a smart purchasing decision during a customer's hearing aid journey.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of the broader impact of this work, it could help to improve the current adoption rate of hearing aids around the world. Only one in three people (33%) with a disabling hearing loss currently choose to purchase hearing aids on average, leaving 2 in 3 people (67%) currently experiencing the negative impact of hearing loss without any hearing health intervention. Recent research also suggests that some individuals who have hearing loss but choose not to purchase and wear a hearing aid could experience a faster rate of cognitive decline. Our technology not only helps convince customers that a hearing aid is worth the investment, it also gamifies the user experience of purchasing hearing aids, making it much more engaging. The combined effect of this will likely cause people who currently do not wear hearing aids to adopt hearing aids sooner, which would help older adults remain active and socially engaged. This continued engagement is thought to stave off cognitive decline, keeping older adults more productive in the workforce and reducing their future healthcare needs and costs as they get older.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Matthew&nbsp;T&nbsp;Neal</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2230843/2230843_10810402_1733328808717_KEMAR_with_hearing_aid--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2230843/2230843_10810402_1733328808717_KEMAR_with_hearing_aid--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Acoustic Manikin\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2230843/2230843_10810402_1733328808717_KEMAR_with_hearing_aid--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Acoustic Manikin\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The acoustic manikin used to recording the hearing aids in different scenes for the sound that would be picked up at the ear drums of the hearing aid wearer.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.
