SODA is a major conference with broad coverage of Theory of Computing and Discrete Mathematics. SODA has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, particularly those from under-represented groups. The conference serves as a valuable educational experience both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
