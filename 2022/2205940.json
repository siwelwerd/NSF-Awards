Specific objectives of the PI meeting include:\r\n\r\n- to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC PIs working on different projects;\r\n- to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and researchers in other disciplines;\r\n- to share experiences and learn from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice; and\r\n- to develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nBuilding a strong community among SaTC researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of existing research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nSome elements of the meeting are structured so as to mitigate risks associated with the spread of COVID-19 or the virtual participation that its spread might necessitate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There were 484 registered participants.  The program consisted of five kinds of activities:\n\nKeynotes: the event had three keynote speakers: Cindy Cohn (Electronic Frontier Foundation), Yi-Kai Liu (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and Renee DiResta (Stanford Internet Observatory).  These keynote speakers represented a variety of perspectives on technologies of interest to the SaTC community.\nPanels: the event had three panels. Two of the panels discussed topics of wide concern to the SaTC community: (1) ethics in security research and (2) trends in offensive vs. defensive security research.
