 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address many of the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons that have, to date, prevented the widespread usefulness of this technology for targeted remote sensing applications. Traditional stratospheric balloons are massive and difficult to operate. They are often hundreds of feet tall, weigh thousands of pounds, costs tens of thousands of dollars, must be launched from fixed locations in near-perfect weather, and are always one-time use. These technical, operational, and financial limitations have led to a largely underutilized stratospheric environment. The first proposed research objective for this effort is the design completion of a small, mobile-launch, durable, and fully reusable altitude stable stratospheric balloon. The second research objective is the design and development of advanced balloon flight trajectory software needed to identify acceptable balloon launch sites that yield successful, targeted remote sensing missions. The third objective is the development of a rapid, mobile-launch platform. The project will culminate with a stratospheric flight test campaign that may demonstrate the combined system innovations, measured by the system\u2019s overall ability to image pre-determined target areas of interest at specified times.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance stratospheric remote sensing technologies while enabling safe, routine, and commercially-viable Earth observation from a stratospheric balloon platform. The stratosphere is relatively void of commercial remote sensing activity, largely due to the limitations associated with traditional stratospheric balloons. Today, stratospheric balloons are commercially unviable for remote sensing applications due to their inability to image specific areas of Earth at desired times, largely due to constraints associated with the need for fixed launch infrastructure, a lack of system directional control, and narrow operational launch windows requiring restrictive launch weather conditions. The novel stratospheric remote sensing balloon that is the subject of this effort may reduce or eliminate many of these constraints, resulting in a zero-emission, mobile-launch, precisely-placeable stratospheric remote sensing balloon that will enable high-resolution, targeted, low-cost Earth observation. This effort may enhance scientific and technological understanding of small stratospheric balloon systems for remote sensing applications and, most importantly, may enable widespread commercial usefulness of the stratosphere for remote sensing applications including remote, real-time wildfire monitoring and rapid, broad-area disaster response awareness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These technical, operational, and financial limitations have led to a largely underutilized stratospheric environment. This SBIR effort addressed many of the technical hurdles behind this disparity, resulting in a novel, reusable, rapidly deployable, and precisely placeable stratospheric remote sensing balloon. The work conducted during this effort involved durable/reusable stratospheric balloon material research, mobile balloon launch R&amp;D, low size, weight and power (SWaP) imaging sensor R&amp;D, flight trajectory software development, and a stratospheric test flight campaign.   \n\n\nIn short, the work conducted during this SBIR effort has led to a now-operational stratospheric Microballoon remote sensing system. The work performed was focused on the advanced development of the Microballoon? system. Microballoons are novel, small, rapidly deployable, mobile-launch, zero-pressure (i.e. altitude stable) stratospheric balloons that offer a new capability to ?place? these systems above specific locations (i.e. pre-determined target areas of interest) at very high altitude in the stratosphere for broad-area, high-resolution, low-cost Earth Observation and remote sensing applications. This system is now routinely capturing high-resolution, low-cost aerial imagery for a variety of customers, spanning use-cases that include environmental monitoring, watershed management and restoration, infrastructure monitoring, and wildfire monitoring.  \n\n\nDuring this Phase I SBIR effort, Urban Sky researched and tested a variety of durable stratospheric balloon materials and designs (shape, size, etc.), eventually modifying its existing Microballoon for optimized performance, which has led to a more durable (I.e. launchable in more weather conditions), more reliable, and more reusable balloon system. In fact, Urban Sky?s Microballoon is the first known reusable stratospheric balloon ever developed. Such an improvement will directly lead to lowering the cost of stratospheric access for scientific and commercial applications.  \n\n\nAnother major success during the effort involved the development of an improved physics-based stratospheric flight planning and modeling engine. Urban Sky?s Microballoon can be launched from the back of a pickup truck in just minutes, producing the need for a flight planning engine that can output a launch region (or regions) based on a desired remote sensing target. This type of launch planning engine did not previously exist for stratospheric balloon systems and was developed and tested during the Phase I SBIR. This engine is now routinely used by Urban Sky flight planners on an operational basis.  \n\n\nThis SBIR effort also saw the development, test and operationalization of a mobile balloon launch vehicle system. Urban Sky has over-hauled its mobile balloon launch system so that a single operator can now launch a Microballoon from the inside of a truck bed in under ten minutes (i.e. without ever leaving the bed of the pickup truck), resulting in a highly capable and flexible mobile deployment system. The launch process previously required two launch operators, ample space/area outside of the launch vehicle, and ~30 minutes for launch of one balloon. Additionally, the launch vehicle was previously only compatible with helium gas for fill, and is now compatible with Helium, Hydrogen and Tri-mix (90% He, 7.5% Ar, and 2.5% CO2).  \n\n\nUrban Sky tested new Microballoon designs, materials, mobile launch and software improvements through a series of full-scale stratospheric test flights in 2022. In short, these improvements have led to a now-operational Microballoon system that is routinely capturing data for commercial and government customers alike. There are significant future planned improvements to allow for global scalability and usefulness of this subject technology. However, this Phase I SBIR effort was critical in advancing the technology to a ?state-of-the-art' environment. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jared Leidich"
