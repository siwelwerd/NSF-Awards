 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nAttracting talented women and men to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields remains a priority for STEM-focused academic departments in the United States. This imperative is underscored by the crucial roles of STEM professionals, directly or indirectly, in the US economy. Entry into the lucrative STEM professions requires high degrees of skill; advancement requires a bachelor's degree, often with additional degrees and certifications. Notably, current demographic disparities in US STEM professionals imply that diverse human talent is being 'left on the table.' To attract more women and men to STEM, City College of New York (CCNY) will establish a regional research training network entitled \u201cOn-Ramp to the Molecular Machine Shop: Postbaccalaureate Training in Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Biodesign (RaMMMP).\u201d The network will foster entry of a diverse cadre of recent bachelor\u2019s degree graduates into careers in demanding scientific fields such as biotechnology, bioengineering, and science education, amongst others. The network will encompass members of the CCNY faculty, external collaborators, technology and professional training specialists, college science department chairs, and current practitioners of diverse science-related occupations who will act as mentors and co-mentors to three cohorts of 12 postbaccalaureate students each. Embedded laboratory experiences, supplemented by professional development workshops and broad-based career exploration activities, will prepare each cohort for rewarding careers in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project will include: 1) mitigating gender, racial, ethnic, and economic disparities in the STEM workforce; and 2) producing an educated citizenry with the know-how to meet the societal challenges of technically complex energy, environmental, and health issues. The heart of the RaMMMP program will be an immersive mentored research experience, enriched by professional development activities and a stimulating community. To ensure robust participation of both student mentees and their faculty mentors in the program, a three-module plan termed 1) Getting Ready, 2) Getting Set, and 3) Getting Going will be implemented. During the Getting Ready phase of the plan, the faculty group will participate in a mentor training workshop, incoming trainees will undergo a 10-session research identity bootcamp, and mentor-mentee partnerships will begin to take shape. The Getting Set stage of the plan will center on building technical skills of trainees, pursuing scientific research projects, developing cohorts, and enhancing communication skills. Finally, the Getting Going phase will focus on pathways to STEM professions, presentations on the diversity of STEM careers, and sampling of diverse employment sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
