 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Midwest Representation Theory Conference, to be held March 11-13, 2022 at the University of Michigan. The conference will gather established experts, recent Ph.D.s, and graduate students to discuss and disseminate new results in the broad area of representation theory of local and adelic points of algebraic groups, a fundamental subject in mathematics, with many applications both inside and outside mathematics. The conference will be the latest in a sequence of conferences that have consistently provided a forum in which students and experts alike present and discuss state-of-the-art-work in the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe conference features invited talks from a diverse cohort of speakers, including several young researchers working in a broad range of topics, as well as contributed talks. Speakers' specialties range widely, with two broad themes being supercuspidal representations, and automorphic forms and L-functions. Supercuspidal representations are the fundamental building blocks of admissible representations of rational points of groups over local fields, and they typically appear as ramified local components of automorphic representations of adelic groups. These, along with their associated L-functions, are central objects of study in modern number theory. The conference website is https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mkrishna/2022mrtc/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
