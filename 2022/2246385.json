 "awd_abstract_narration": "Livestock management is plagued by two major sources of risk: environmental variability and economic security. This is experienced more acutely in rural and arid settings, where infrastructural development and market access may be more limited, and where drought contributes to lower nutrient quality impacting livestock outcomes (weight loss, disease and parasite susceptibility, and mortality). Despite the risks to herding associated with ecological shocks, little Is known about how economic forecasting varies among households. This project will test whether models that have been used in simulations and laboratory settings in behavioral ecology to understand positive and negative shocks on economic behavior can also be applied in a natural experiment to evaluate variation in risk exposure, shock categorization, and economic forecasting. The research explores household decision-making in the aftermath of a major hurricane. Critical data and findings about the relationship between ecological shock, risk preference, and economic decision-making will be disseminated to organizations and officials to assist with future economic planning. The project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, builds capacity for conducting future scientific work, and broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science.\r\n\r\nThe researchers explore 1) how variation in hurricane-induced asset loss influence people to categorize it as either positive or negative, and 2) how ecological shock categorization (positive vs negative) and prior condition (good vs poor) influences how people reason about future ecological conditions, herd management strategies, and their likelihood for engaging in productive labor. These questions will be explored using semi-structured interviews and surveys from 100 households across four communities. Data collection will be oriented toward documenting how individuals characterize the range of variation in post-hurricane household losses, how they perceive loss from the recent hurricane compared to past catastrophic anthropogenic disasters, and what projections they have with respect to future ecological shocks and economic behavior. Studies of disasters in anthropology, development economics, and other scientific fields have focused on the negative shocks that natural disaster events have on risk preferences and economic decision-making, seldom exploring what positive ecological shocks may be emerging in post-disaster contexts. Behavioral ecologists have modeled positive and negative shocks on economic behavioral in simulated models and in laboratory environments, but not in naturalistic settings. This project conducts a novel natural experiment in this post-disaster context.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While they are generally seen as being bad for humans, because of their unpredictable nature, ecological shocks can create a variety of outcomes for people - some might experience them negatively, while others might experience them positively. For example, hurricanes could represent a positive shock to some if it brings much needed moisture to an otherwise drought-stricken region, or it could be a negative shock if it results in economic losses. This research project sought to understand how people would respond following an ecological shock that produced both positive and negative outcomes. On September 8, 2022, Hurricane Kay made landfall on Baja California Sur, Mexico, a region that had not received rain for nearly three years. Cattle and goat ranchers who relied on seasonal rains had been very negatively impacted by the previous 3-year drought. We wanted to understand 1) whether these ranchers thought the hurricane was good or bad for their livelihoods, 2) whether some households suffered worse consequences than others from the hurricane, and 3) whether the amount of damage a household suffered (or how wealthy they were) influenced how they would responded to the hurricane - specifically whether they planned to sell more livestock on the market.
