 "awd_abstract_narration": "In August of 2017, the Great American Eclipse traversed the continental United States from Oregon to South Carolina. The Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (Citizen CATE) successfully deployed over 300 volunteer citizen scientists at 68 sites to continuously observe totality from coast to coast. That effort resulted in a novel and unique dataset containing 90 minutes of continuous coverage of the inner solar corona. On April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse (TSE) will again traverse United States, this time from Texas to Maine. The project outlined here is to build on the successes of CATE 2017 and improve the observations with upgraded instrumentation to include a larger-format camera and polarization measurements, providing a wider field of view and diagnostic of coronal density not previously possible. CATE 2024 project will deploy 40 teams of citizen scientists along the path of totality to collect over 60 minutes of high-resolution data, which will be used to study the hard to observe middle corona. Previous planning work including site selection, identification of necessary equipment, and initial development of the citizen science network has already been carried out. This project will begin the implementation of the planned activities, which includes equipment purchase and telescope building; training on equipment and in solar astronomy for citizen science teams that will train teams within their regions; and implementing software upgrades to ensure consistency in data collection. Practice with the equipment for the citizen science training teams includes a workshop to be held at the Southwest Research Institute campus and travel to Australia for the April 2023 total solar eclipse. The project\u2019s broader societal impact includes engagement with Native American and other underrepresented community groups along the eclipse path and the donation of telescopes to community groups for their use after the eclipse. \r\n\r\nCATE 2024 will use high-cadence high dynamic range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the corona to characterize the physical processes that shape the heating, structure, and evolution of the solar corona at scales that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. The science objectives of CATE 2024 are to (1) determine the connectivity of structures that span the middle corona, where the coronal magnetic field transitions from primarily closed to primarily open; (2) measure the flow of the nascent solar wind, by characterizing small scale dynamics that occur during the eclipse; and (3) identify and characterize magnetic reconnection, which is believed to generate structure in the solar wind and to heat the low and middle corona, by identifying features and dynamics related to this process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

CATE 2024 leveraged lessons learned from the original NSF-funded Citizen CATE experiment in 2017 (led by Dr. Matt Penn). The CATE 2024 next-generation experiment's primary science goals were to measure the corona in polarized visible light during the 1-hour duration of eclipse totality over the U.S., to better understand how the Sun's magnetic field is structured and connected in the corona, and how it evolves; and how the solar wind -- a constant stream of particles from the corona -- is formed and accelerated outwards. Simultaneously, CATE's education and outreach goals were to engage with varied, diverse, and historically underserved and overburdened communities along the eclipse path, to provide STEM engagement and training to our community participants, and to provide a unique experience to engage with the total solar eclipse while carrying out world-class scientific research. The primary objective of this Phase 1 award was to carry out initial planning, development, and implementation activities for CATE 2024 in preparation for the 2024 eclipse, culminating in observing the 2023 April 20 total solar eclipse from Exmouth, Australia. Because Phase 2 activities overlapped with the latter half of this award, the 2024 eclipse observations also occurred during this award.</p>\n<p>During Phase 1, our primary accomplishments included:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Logistical planning:</strong></em> we studied the number of community sites needed to provide the continuous 1 hour of observing across the U.S. while also avoiding the risk of interruptions due to clouds or other circumstances. We determined that 35 sites along the path would fulfill project goals, identified preliminary locations, and surveyed communities around those locations to identify potential team applicants.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Equipment evaluation:</strong></em> multiple cameras, telescopes, and other accessories could enable CATE observations. We identified candidate equipment and vendors, and procured samples of cameras, telescopes, tracking mounts, and other equipment to test and evaluate in preparation for buying 35 copies of each for 2024. We were able to pack an entire site's equipment into one airline-legal Pelican case. The equipment was tested at a real eclipse in Australia.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Software and procedures:</strong></em> we refined custom software, originally developed for the 2017 eclipse, that provided an accessible and easy-to-use interface to the camera to make eclipse observations. We developed and refined a step-by-step guide on setting up the observing equipment and making the detailed eclipse observations needed for CATE's science.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Recruitment and training:</strong></em> during Phase 1, we recruited three \"Regional Coordinators\" and three \"Lead Trainers\" who served as community leaders to help recruit state-level coordinators and trainers and the 35 teams of local community participants. We held a 2-day workshop for team-building and to train them on the equipment and observing procedures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Australian eclipse:</strong></em> Phase 1 activities culminated in a trip to Exmouth, Australia with the 6 Regional Coordinators and Lead Trainers to observe the 2023 April 20 total solar eclipse. This enabled a real-world test of the CATE equipment, software, and procedures, which provided not only useful scientific data but also help in making refinements for 2024, and provided a unique experience for the community participants. The observations were executed flawlessly by the participants. A YouTube livestream is available from the expedition (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jdW4BUptGo).</p>\n<p>Phase 2 activities occurred together with another NSF grant during the latter half of this award, and were directly enabled by this Phase 1 award.
