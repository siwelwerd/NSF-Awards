 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mapping animal populations is a powerful approach for learning what factors are important to\r\nthe species. By comparing records of where animals are common, rare, or absent with local\r\nenvironmental conditions researchers can quantify the relative effects of habitat, climate, and\r\nhuman disturbances. The proliferation of new animal data from camera traps and citizen\r\nscientists allows these questions to be asked at larger scales, but this also introduces a new\r\nproblem of local specialization - do bears in Florida respond to the environment in the same\r\nways as bears in Maine? Can we have one model that predicts a species abundance across its\r\nrange? This project will address this question by evaluating to what extent different populations\r\nare consistent in their response to environmental factors across the country. The resulting maps\r\nwill show where mammal species are more or less common, which will be useful for\r\nconservation and wildlife management. Furthermore, the results will also highlight which local\r\nor national environmental factors are driving these patterns, which could be useful when\r\nmitigating climate change, designating habitat corridors, or planning other active population\r\nmanagement techniques. Comparing these results across 100 North American species will\r\nshow the broader importance of local ecological specialization in mammal evolution. In addition\r\nto publications, the results will be shared through the Wild Animals podcast and YouTube\r\nchannel, including the best camera trap footage.\r\n\r\nThis project asks to what extent the ecological niche reflects range-wide tendencies of a species\r\n(i.e. phylogenetic conservatism) vs. local adaptation by a population. This is a critical question\r\nnot only for understanding evolution, but also when considering how to manage populations\r\nfacing climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. The project will test the hypothesis that\r\necological similarity should parallel phylogenetic similarity and also compare the degree of local\r\nadaptation to natural (climate and vegetation) vs. anthropogenic factors. To meet these\r\nobjectives, researchers will create continental scale species distribution models for\r\napproximately 100 North American mammal species using data integration techniques that\r\ncombine traditional museum data with \u2018born digital\u2019 data from camera traps and citizen science.\r\nThese new data include camera trap surveys at NEON sites and from the Snapshot USA\r\nprogram which runs annually in all 50 states. The Snapshot program surveys 1500 sites/yr\r\nthrough a massive collaboration between 150+ scientists, including many undergraduate\r\nclasses (>800 students from 40 institutions) and underserved communities. The project will\r\ngrow this network by recruiting more participants, providing timely results that they can use with\r\ntheir students with prepared classroom modules, offering online data analysis workshops for\r\nparticipants, and making the data publicly available each year. This hierarchical, integrated,\r\nspatially-varying model approach will allow researchers to address new questions about the\r\nscale of ecological adaptation and whether natural factors still regulate most species or if\r\nevolutionary responses to anthropogenic changes are outpacing these natural processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
