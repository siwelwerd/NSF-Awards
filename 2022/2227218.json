 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will host a 3-day workshop with a broad and diverse group of researchers and practitioners from various disciplines and from a variety of institutions and companies around the general theme of climate science, sustainability, and clean energy.  This in-person meeting will be held in the Washington DC area in fall 2022.   Participants will work together to develop recommendations to federal research and development agencies for support of research and education to advance scientific knowledge, anticipate future conditions, accelerate clean energy innovations and sustainable practices, and increase resilience in the face of climate change.  The ultimate deliverable will be a synthesis report representing the major challenges, themes, and suggestions.  The report will include an appendix of whitepapers that delve deeper into specific challenges, as well as links to presentations that will be available on a SIAM webpage.\r\n\r\nThis SIAM Convening on Climate Science, Sustainability, and Clean Energy aims to (i) result in a better understanding of the challenges and problems affecting research innovation and translation gleaned from discussions across the various sectors and communities; (ii) provide input and recommendations for addressing the challenges and opportunities identified; and (iii) identify mechanisms to encourage the growth and health of the research workforce. In 2021, SIAM distributed to the NSF and to other federal agencies the document \u201cResearch and Education Priorities to Address Climate Change, Boost Environmental Resilience, and Advance Clean Energy\u201d which was prepared by a task force established under the SIAM Committee on Science Policy.  That report represented the applied mathematics and computational science viewpoint; this convening will build on the previous study by including other disciplines to expand the perspective and broaden its impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
