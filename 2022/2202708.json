 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goal of the research is to investigate the sensitivity of reactive halogen abundance to glacial-interglacial climate change in a global model and examine its implications for ice core proxies. The research specifically focuses on three research questions: 1) Can blowing snow on sea ice explain the increase in Sodium ions observed in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores on the glacial-interglacial timescale; 2) What are the biggest drivers for changes in the abundance of reactive halogens over the glacial-interglacial timescale; and 3) What are the potential implications for the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and short-lived climate forcing agents Methane, Tropospheric Ozone, and Aerosols.\r\n\r\nThis project will help improve the understanding of reactive halogens over a major climate transition and examine the implications of their role in climate feedbacks via their influence on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere.  The atmospheric abundance of Methane, Ozone, and Aerosols may have significant impacts on the Earth\u2019s climate system over a variety of timescales through their direct and indirect radiative forcing, as well as impacts on biogeochemical cycling due to their influence on the biosphere.  The project also provides support for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
