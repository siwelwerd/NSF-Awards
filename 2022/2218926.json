 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a pain-free, lab-under-the-skin wearable technology for continuous, and real-time monitoring of multiple biomarkers of significance such as alcohol, glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, testosterone, cortisol, insulin, and more. The proposed lab-under-the-skin device may potentially promote public health for the treatment and prevention of alcohol misuse, more effective management of diabetes in the ever-growing population of people affected with diabetes, and timely diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of infectious diseases such as sepsis in hospitals or at-home settings. In addition, the device may be adopted for performance, health, and fitness use cases, which may aid in educating individuals in understanding their own physiology and metabolism, and personalized nutrition.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a wearable sensor for continuous monitoring of model analytes namely alcohol, glucose, and lactate. The proposed technology is based on a quarter-sized electrochemical sensor that uses a microneedle array with wireless communication to the wearer\u2019s smartphone. The barely visible micron-scale array of microneedles enables continuous access to the molecular information-rich biofluid beneath the skin in a pain- and discomfort-free manner. The preliminary results of continuous monitoring were promising for all investigated biomarkers, with the sensors\u2019 data being in perfect correlation with those obtained from gold-standard metrics. Product and market validation activities by the interviews with potential end-users, decision-makers, and influencers throughout this I-Corps project will bring increased certainty and focus during the product development efforts on the choice of biomarkers that are immediate needs of the prospect market segments.  In addition, the goal is to address the true need of the end-user, and to develop what has tangible commercial value and a broader impact on society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
