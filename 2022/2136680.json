 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is the potential use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) applications in performing inspections and repairs on a variety of live transmission equipment without the need for manned helicopter or bucket truck crews, reducing the time linemen are in harm\u2019s way. The cost of transmission grid inspections and maintenance may decrease, leading to more frequent routine inspection and more timely and proactive inspections of infrastructure with potential for failure. Transmission grid operators may have a more resilient grids with lower losses thanks to increased and improved data from frequent inspections. The American people can potentially benefit from a more resilient grid with fewer outages and more consistent delivery of electricity. Fewer line losses conserve energy and reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned to generate electricity locally. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) inspection capabilities enabling access to utility infrastructure unreachable and/or difficult to reach by current methods. Inspection, maintenance, repair, and auditing processes for electrical utility infrastructure are costly and hazardous to personnel. Current UAS-mounted payload technology has demonstrated initial success with inspecting connectors by approaching horizontally-arranged transmission conductor sets from above. Vertically-arranged conductors that cannot be approached from above represent a significant portion of transmission infrastructure. The project\u2019s research seeks develop UAS payload system technology that delivers linemen\u2019s tools to vertically-arranged, high voltage transmission infrastructure by approaching from the side and from below. To accomplish this research, new approach methods will be designed, engineered, constructed, and rigorously tested in de-energized and live environments to prove viability. Completing the research objectives of the project may establish commercial feasibility for the next generation of UAS payload technology in the electrical utility sector, paving the way for a safer and more efficient national electrical grid.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
