 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of a system that could provide more cost-effective and easier-to-use tools for scientists in electrophysiology, and possibly allow the improved characterization of dense electrogenic cell cultures. The technology may allow pharmaceutical companies the ability to better understand how cells respond to new drugs and could provide more informed, data-driven decisions during clinical trials. This innovation could also provide biologic manufacturers with more information regarding the development of their cell cultures which may reduce production costs associated with failed cell cultures. In addition, academic scientists may utilize this technology to characterize information transfer in large neural populations and which may unlock new insights in fields such as neuroscience.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel system for phenotypic screening and monitoring in electrophysiology. The system monitors the electrical activity of cardiomyocytes, neurons, and other cells to characterize their behavior and health with potentially more spatial resolution, throughput, and monitoring time than other systems. This may allow drug development and biologics manufacturing to gather more data and develop more robust assays for their product pipelines. The current approach to monitoring cells for phenotypic screening involves the use of microelectrode arrays, which can be limited in spatial resolution, are comparatively low throughput, and may cost more for industries to utilize. This technology uses a novel optical sensor that combines plasmonics with electrochromics to possibly create a platform that would be wireless, high resolution, and high throughput for long-term monitoring of electrophysiology. This platform may enable the development of cheaper, more robust assays as well as entirely new characterizations of cell health and information exchange in cell populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
