 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award provides support for U.S. based participants of the conference \u201cChromatic Homotopy Theory and Friends\", to be held at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, Djursholm, Sweden, during June 7-10, 2022. The meeting aims to bring together leading researchers, postdocs, and graduate students working in the field, with a focus on recruitment, retention and mentoring of women researchers, who form an under-represented group in mathematics.  The event would provide an entry point to research in chromatic homotopy theory and opportunity to start collaboration. The activities are designed to attract early career researchers to the field and facilitate mentoring  relationships with the goal of improved retention and continued success.\r\n\r\nChromatic homotopy theory is a cornerstone in modern algebraic topology. It is a conceptual and computational framework for identifying and explaining large scale periodic patterns in stable homotopy groups. Beyond its original focus, chromatic homotopy theory has grown into an organizational principle with applications in areas such as algebraic geometry and modular representation theory. It provides a direct yet mysterious relationship between stable homotopy theory and number theory through modular and automorphic forms. This workshop will consist of an introductory series of lectures on chromatic homotopy, and additional invited and contributed lectures on adjacent areas, such as equivariant and motivic homotopy theory. Details are available at http://www.mittag-leffler.se/konferens/ewm-ems-summer school-chromatic-homotopy-theory-and-friends.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
