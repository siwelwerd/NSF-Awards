 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulence is ubiquitous in nature, playing a fundamental role in a multitude of physical theories, from atmospheric and oceanic dynamics to the birth of stars. This project is dedicated to an investigation into hydrodynamic and wave turbulence, both of which, at the core predict cascades of energy. The principal aim of this supported research is to better understand these energy cascades. The project is divided into two projects: a study of non-uniqueness of weak solutions to equations arising in hydrodynamics, and a rigorous approach to the derivation of the kinetic wave equation in wave turbulence theory. \r\n \r\nThe focus of the first project will be to utilize the theoretical tool of convex integration to build theoretical energy cascades in order to resolve long standing open problems related to weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. The overarching goal of the second project will be to rigorously determine the validity of the kinetic wave equation which is theorized to predict turbulence phenomena in a host settings such as water waves, plasma physics and climate science. The project will draw on a diverse set of mathematical tools from analysis, number theory and statistical physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key result from this research is the paper 'Onset of the wave turbulence description of the longtime behavior of the nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation'. Wave turbulence is thought to describe a wide range of physical phenomena. A cornerstone of the theory is the so-called wave kinetic equation. The kinetic wave equation however lacked a mathematically rigorous derivation. The paper 'Onset of the wave turbulence description of the longtime behavior of the nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation' applied novel techniques from analysis, number theory and probability in order to present the first rigorous derivation of the kinetic wave equation for the nonlinear Schr &#776;odinger equation. The paper has launched an exciting new research program on mathematical wave turbulence.  The paper also formed a foundation piece in a grant proposal that led to the multi-million dollar, international Simons Collaboration on Wave Turbulence, for which the PI is a founding PI. The Simons Collaboration involves mathematicians and physicists from the US and Europe working towards better understanding wave turbulence which describes diverse physical phenomena such as turbulence in surface water waves, optical fibre and solar flares.\n\nA series of papers funded by this award help settle fundamental open problems related to 3D shock formation in fluids. The work provides the first full description of shock development; in particular, in addition to describing the shock front, the paper  'Simultaneous development of shocks and cusps for 2D Euler with azimuthal symmetry from smooth data' describes two other characteristic surfaces, first conjectured by Landau and Lifschitz. The paper is the first mathematics or physics paper to describe the surfaces, serving as a great example of mathematics informing physics. \n\nFinally, the paper 'Self-similar blow-up profile for the Boussinesq equations via a physics-informed neural network' has helped jumpstart an exciting new research direction, employing neural networks together with hard analysis to tackle some of the most fundamental problems intimately related to one of the seven millennium prize problems. The paper was featured in a recent Quanta article and podcast episode.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tristan Buckmaster"
