 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance a real-time assessment system for patients at risk of respiratory distress.  The goal is to monitor these patients and avoid hospital admissions or re-admissions for previously discharged patients.  The first envisioned application is monitoring of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), for which there is no cure - but the disease can be managed with diligent surveillance.  The envisioned remote patient monitoring system will enhance patient care and outcomes by providing early warning of COPD flare-ups, thus reducing the need for emergency hospital visits and admissions.  This system will provide healthcare workers and caregivers added time to implement protocols, such as inhaler-based drug delivery, thus reducing critical events for COPD, as well as COVID-19, asthma, pneumonia, and other respiratory illnesses. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a reusable device monitoring biomarkers of nociceptive pain, dyspnea, and coughing dynamics, along with traditional vital sign measurements. The project will develop a reusable device with a rechargeable battery and replaceable adhesives for prolonged use during the duration of the monitoring period.  Additionally, the user interface will be optimized for the display of pertinent symptoms to the patient, caregivers, and medical personnel providing remote care from a centralized monitoring center.  The efficient sharing of continuous changes in patient status will allow for the most effective personalized treatment. The project will develop a system with appropriate cybersecurity protocols.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
