 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop and commercialize an ocular gene therapy to reverse the effects of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting over 11 million Americans today and representing the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the United States. The proposed treatment has the potential to preserve independence, economic stability, and quality of life of those affected by AMD and reduce US healthcare costs with just a single treatment.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project technical plan will optimize the formulation, dose, and route of administration of an investigational therapy in a large animal model. The project will first develop gene therapy formulations with various vehicles. The formulations\u2019 efficiency in retinal tissues with an injection into the eye will be assessed with preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses. Toxicology studies will be performed to assess safety and efficacy of the novel formulation and the injection route at various doses over 3 months. Subsequently, the project will assess risk in manufacturing the gene delivery vehicles to ensure that high concentrations can be manufactured for future clinical use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The development of our novel gene therapy, OCLX-001, aims to prevent the progression of iAMD to the more severe AMD stage that triggers blindness in 3-5 years. By restoring and maintaining cellular function in the retina, OCLX-001 has the potential to fundamentally alter the management of AMD, delivering a much-needed solution to lengthen effective vision and reduce the burden of blindness in the aging population.</p>\r\n<p>AMD is a prevalent eye condition in individuals over 40. Most cases start as \"dry\" AMD, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that leads to lipofuscin buildup and subsequent cell death in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors. AMD progresses from intermediate dry AMD (iAMD) to advanced AMD, which causes vision loss and significantly impacts the patient&rsquo;s quality of life. Until very recently, no FDA approved pharmaceutical existed for Americans with AMD who are not at the advanced stage. Current treatments for advanced AMD do not improve vision and pose compliance challenges due to their frequent and painful dosing requirements. Given the substantial economic burden of vision disability from advanced AMD, costing the US economy over $49 billion annually, there is a critical need for efficient treatments that can address the disease in its earlier stages to prevent disease progression and reduce healthcare costs.</p>\r\n<p>Oculogenex is advancing a novel solution with an investigational gene therapy named OCLX-001, aimed at preserving sight in patients with iAMD through the restoration of BMI1, a key epigenetic regulator that enhances mitochondrial function, increases cellular resistance to oxidative stress, and activates M&uuml;ller cells. The therapy involves a one-time injection of OCLX-001 into the suprachoroidal (SC) space of the eye with an easy to use, reliable delivery device developed by Oculogenex (OCLX-SCDD). Promising preclinical data have been generated with OCLX-001 using multiple animal studies. OCLX-001 preserves retinal structure and function under stress by increasing BMI1 protein levels to those in young healthy adults, nearly double the BMI1 level in older adults. The longer-lasting gene therapy effects and ease of administration with the OCLX-SCDD device promises to enhance patient compliance and increase access to underserved groups.</p>\r\n<p>The remaining OCLX-001 preclinical development studies will involve crucial assessments of pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity in minipigs to guide clinical dosing and ensure product safety. OCLX-001 has the potential to address a significant gap in the treatment landscape for AMD.
