 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). California State University Northridge (CSUN) is one of the largest universities in the US with annual enrollment over 40,000 students and is classified as both a Hispanic-serving and Minority-serving institution. Approximately 55% of the total student population is of Hispanic background. CSUN is partnering with the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM) at Caltech with an intent to  foster multidisciplinary and innovative research in quantum matter and quantum information science, to educate and train students in cutting-edge quantum research, and to increase recruitment, retention, and degree attainment by members of groups underrepresented in research. Multipronged strategies will be carried out to recruit students from underrepresented groups (URGs). Both undergraduate and graduate students, mostly from URGs, will be involved in the cutting-edge research of quantum matter and information, mentored by the faculty, and will graduate with B.S. and M.S. degrees, respectively. Summer schools will be offered at CSUN introducing undergraduate and graduate students to the exciting world of quantum information science. Research training programs provided by the Caltech IQIM will be offered to CSUN undergraduates. A new set of courses on quantum simulations and quantum computing will be developed. Partnership with industry and national laboratories for student training and internships will also be developed. The integration of research and education will enable students to make informed career choices and improve their ability to participate in post-graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis PREP award aims to address fundamental problems in quantum materials that have vital scientific and tech nonlogical importance as well as economical and societal impacts. A multidisciplinary team with coordinated and complementary skills in theory, computation and experiment is assembled into two interdisciplinary groups (IRGs): IRG1 -- Driven and strongly interacting quantum matter, IRG2 -- Searching for novel quantum phases in realistic materials. IRG1 will tackle fundamental problems in driven and strongly correlated quantum matter which has potential applications in quantum information science. This includes topological phenomena in driven quantum systems, exotic properties of quantum spin liquids emerging from Kitaev materials, and doping Mott insulators to discover unconventional superconductivity for Kitaev materials. IRG2 will focus on searching for material candidates that realize novel quantum phases, including two-dimensional Moir\u00e9 materials based on graphene, transition-metal trihalides and phosphorous trichalcogenides, and rare-earth tellurides, which may exhibit a plethora of intriguing phases, including superconducting, topological, magnetic, and charge density wave.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
