 "awd_abstract_narration": "The catastrophic and deadly floods affecting eastern Kentucky during the last few days of July 2022 provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand within a geologic context the distribution of potentially harmful contaminants in recent flood deposits in a way that will help inform future public health assessments and interventions in public health, geology, and climate science. With a multidisciplinary team bringing together expertise in geomorphology, sedimentology, geohealth, epidemiology, and toxicology, the researchers will perform a rapid evaluation of flood deposit geomorphology and toxicity in the wake of an unprecedented flood event in eastern Kentucky. \r\n\r\nThe research goals are to measure the extent, morphology, and stratigraphy of mappable flood deposits within key selected drainages affected by the July 2022 floods in eastern Kentucky, and to measure the distribution and timing of metals, organics, and other contaminants with public health implications within the newly deposited sediments. The team will use geomorphological mapping, UAV-based lidar microtopographic surveys, digital terrain modeling, and both field- and lab-based geochemical sampling to begin understanding the geologic and hydrologic controls on contaminant distribution of the flood deposits. In addition to identifying the instantaneous spatial variability of recent flood deposit geochemistry, the research will form the foundation for future long-term studies of flood sediment deposition, contaminant migration and fate. It will also inform on how steep mountain landscapes respond to catastrophic flooding events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe primary aim of this project was to acquire perishable data related to the July 27-28, 2022 flooding in eastern Kentucky.  Perishable data collected during the project includes the coarse mapping of flood deposits, recording 113 measurements of the maximum flood water height, collecting 102 water samples for chemical analysis and 57 sediment samples for grain size and chemical analysis, and noting locations of over 1000 landslides and debris flows (See Figure-1).  Measurement data and observations are preserved digitally for future assessment.  Water samples were measured and sediment samples have been dried and stored. \nAnecdotal evidence from conversations with flood victims led to two important conclusions: 1) more than 5 survivors stated that if they had 15 minutes of warning than they could have saved a family members life and 2) many members of the community reporting having changed the geometry of channels with tractors over the last 30 years.  Field observations showed many bridges were washed out during the flood event.  Surviving bridges were, generally, more substantial concrete highway types, often displayed blockage from vehicles, trees, and root balls.  We are currently developing a model of the flood using the observations and data collected in the field along with USGS gauge stations for parametrization of one sub-catchment located in Letcher County.  \nMajor outcomes are broken down into two distinct types, data collection and identification of flood dynamics in need of targeted investigation.  \nData Collection: \n\n\nAs described above, water and sediment samples were collected according to a systematic strategy and assessed when possible.  Significant water contaminants were not identified except for a few known problematic locations. \n\n\nMaximum flood height data was collected. Critical observations about changes in channel geometry and topography over time due to anthropogensis were noted.  \n\n\nDespite existing alert mechanisms, a strong desire for 15-minutes of warning was repeatedly made during conversations with flood victims.  \n\n\nAreas for future targeted investigation:\n\n\nSediment samples need to be assessed for grain size and chemistry to better understand discharge and the impact of significant quantities of coal in overbank sediments.\n\n\nThe role of changes to channel geometry (narrowing and straightening) by residents and local government on the severity of flooding needs investigation.\n\n\nThe role of changes to topography via large area mining (ex. mountaintop removal and large hollow fills) on the severity of flooding needs investigation.\n\n\nMany small tributaries contained debris flows blocking culverts, the contribution of which to severe flooding needs to be better understood.  \n\n\nThe effects of debris buildup behind bridge piers (blocking flow) on flood severity warrants further investigation.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ryan Thigpen"
