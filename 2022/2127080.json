 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a precision three-dimensional (3D) optical metrology tool for in-process quality control. The proposed tool uses a high-resolution, computer-defined 3D light field to perform rapid multipoint non-contact measurements on parts during the fabrication process. The tool uses an adaptive process to enable 3D metrology with sub-10-micron resolution, at a fraction of the price of competing technologies. Low-volume, high-precision manufacturing plays a critical role in the global economy and is currently a limiting factor in the creation of new assembly lines, larger volume manufacturing, research timelines, and tool creation. The tool itself will benefit small businesses in hardware development by improving part quality through feedback during the manufacturing process. Already, surface inspection systems account for a global $3.7 billion market which is projected to grow to $5.3 billion over the next five years. This strategically impactful innovation is aimed at assisting small businesses, students, trainees, and professional specialty machinists in achieving complex, precision tolerances on low-volume parts.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project advances core technology for precise optical projections, based on a novel component that generates a computer-defined high-resolution projected light field to enable both versatility and high-performance metrology. A programmable light field creates the opportunity for direct user feedback by projecting real-time measurement information onto the part under inspection. The objective of this study is to measure and optimize the design of this programmable device by experimentally evaluating the device stability, field of view, spatial resolution, and efficiency for several design permutations. Additional goals include evaluating the device for its manufacturability, repeatability, and commercial viability. Simulations suggest capabilities including a 60-degree angular field of view and sub-10-micron projection spot size at a nominal working distance of 40 centimeters. Further development of this core technology, when combined with commercially available components, will enable the creation of a compact, high-precision, economically viable tool that provides exceptional reliability for metrology applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our flagship product, HoloProbe, generates these measurements by using adaptive optics - similar to how ground-based telescopes correct for atmospheric distortion. HoloProbe's adaptive projector uses both the amplitude and phase of laser light to structure a large Field-of-View (FOV) hologram. In conjunction with optical sensors and an iterative model, we use this structured light-field to perform micron-scale measurements across meter-scale parts. Far superior to current state-of-the-art non-contact measurement tools, HoloProbe achieves the precision of interferometry, but over large arbitrary 3D surfaces.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Outcomes related to Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>HoloProbe contains a series of novel optical elements that create a true 3D projection in space. This 3D light field is enabled via recent advances in non-linear optical materials and principles of inverse design / machine learning. Our system projects a 10 micron diameter \"dot\" (full width half max spot size) in space, which can be programmatically moved in 1-micron increments in X, Y or Z. We can use this as an optical probe, where sensors on the HoloProbe iteratively move this dot in space, based on the interaction of the dot with the part's surface, to acquire precision measurements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During this Phase I SBIR, our biggest outcome was practical: we have built a functional, large FOV holographic projector based on the concepts described in our proposal, using a fundamentally new optical methodology. To achieve this, our team optimized and characterized a number of performance parameters related to the adaptive projector within a HoloProbe bench-top prototype. We reported on metrics such as the achieved full-width-half-max of the projected spot, the systematic design of the optical elements used in the projector system, the precision of the incremental/programmable motion of the spot, and the maximum possible field-of-view of the entire system. We also reported on the optical efficiency (effectively how \"bright\" the projected dot is relative to ambient light) of the system and the approximate frame rate of the projector. These exhaustive technical benchmarks are critical to the next stage of our research and development plan, which involves incorporating this adaptive projector into HoloProbe's full prototype and product design. In all cases, our holographic projector either exceeded or met the estimated necessary benchmarks for system integration into our HoloProbe prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Outcomes related to Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In addition to our technical outcomes, Diffract Technology Inc. has developed a deep understanding of the potential impact that this technology would have - both on the target market sector (metrology and US manufacturing) and on potential future markets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our team completed over 30 user interviews, and synthesized quantitative frameworks for the numerous insights from customers. For example, one of the key insights from our users was the importance of data logging to track the performance of shop equipment over its usage lifetime. In future, designing this tool with a user interface that incorporates modes not only for measurements but also for in-situ monitoring is something we are actively working on and that this non-contact technology is uniquely capable of achieving in these environments. Other key insights included those related to educational usage of the instrument (e.g. training machinists), and those related to independent/automated assessment to avoid shipping any parts out of tolerance (esp related to medium-scale / bulk manufacturing processes). In general, our target beachhead market for this technology seems both impactful while also being quite feasible to allow entry of a product of this type.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Finally, we also have recently made progress in also identifying future markets&nbsp; - markets that are interested in the idea of true 3D holographic interfaces - but even more specifically: 3D projections with the</span><span> simultaneous capacity </span><span>for precision sensing (to sub-10-micron dimension). The markets that have connected with us and that we have also started to learn more about include the self-driving car sector, the augmented-reality (AR) sector (particularly to enable interactivity that is dimensionally-sensitive) and the medical robotics sector. We envision our holographic projector technology eventually projecting full images&nbsp; / image sequences (rather than just a spot).
