 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Boston University, located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from under-represented groups, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The research will be conducted in the area of cell and molecular biology and will be important for training the next generation of scientists in this important research area for the nation\u2019s technological development. Assessment of the program will be done through online surveys. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths and program training outcomes.\r\n\r\nStudents in this REU Site will be trained primarily by mentors in the Biology Department at Boston University and will carry out research related to the control of gene expression for biological impact. Research will be conducted using a variety of organismal and cell-based models and will use state-of-the-art methods for examining gene expression. In addition to research, students will be trained in responsible conduct of research (scientific ethics), diversity in the workplace, and career development. Students will apply to the program through an online application form, and students will be selected by program staff in consultation with potential research mentors. Sample research projects include the effects of climate change on gene expression patterns in coral and sea anemone models, gene networks in basal and stimulated immune cells, and gene programs involved in the development of muscle cells, sea urchin embryos, and plant structures. More information about the program is available by visiting http://bu.edu/surf, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Thomas D. Gilmore at gilmore@bu.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
