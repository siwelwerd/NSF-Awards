 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the analysis, design, and development of energy-efficient, optimized, fault-tolerant, and secure Internet of Things (IoT) for the deployment of monitoring systems, and particularly, campus monitoring systems. It aims at establishing a solid theoretical foundation to build such systems using a combination of computational geometry techniques, which are based on graph models and convex polyhedra, and cryptography techniques. The former techniques help address the problems of coverage and data gathering and delivery in these IoT-based systems, while the latter ones help cope with the existence of injected bad sensors. This theoretical foundation for fault-tolerant and secure monitoring systems enables the development of a TAMUK campus monitoring system with a special focus on campus people traffic monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis project helps recruit, train, and mentor underrepresented minority students and female students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, which gives them exposure to the theory and practice that support the design and development of fault-tolerant and secure IoT-based campus monitoring systems. In particular, it allows the students to get exposure to various concepts related to polyhedral space-fillers, graph theoretical approaches, cryptography techniques, and real sensor deployment. This research project helps integrate research and education via the development of curriculum and resources for teaching, thus expanding access to advanced higher education to a broader spectrum of undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, this theoretical foundation can serve as the basis for building a unified fault-tolerant and secure IoT-based campus monitoring systems, including environment, building energy, facility, and road traffic. This theoretical foundation can also help build cost-effective, fault-tolerant, secure IoT-based monitoring systems of national importance, such as U.S. boarder surveillance. The findings and results of this research project can be disseminated using local, national, and international conferences, and also published in prestigious and highly reputed journals, such as ACM Transactions and IEEE Transactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
