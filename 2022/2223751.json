 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of sustainable and customizable trimmings for the apparel industry that are biodegradable to reduce the negative environmental effects in landfills. Currently, the creation of trimmings and embellishments such as buttons and sequins for the fashion industry is done using petroleum-based plastics. These embellishments are not biodegradable, making up for a sizable portion of the 14 million tons of waste produced annually by the apparel industry. The proposed technology uses plant-based plastics and small order minimums to partner with designers that are looking for customizable and biodegradable alternatives. Plant-based plastics are expected to degrade naturally in the environment once placed in the landfill at a minimal environmental cost. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of biodegradable and industrially compostable trimmings and embellishments for the apparel industry. The proposed trimmings will be made from sustainable plant-based biodegradable polymer with a variety of fashion features such as brightness, texture, and shape.  In addition, using computer numerical control (CNC) technology such as computer-aided design, laser cutting, and 3D printing, these products may be created with minimal waste without sacrificing quality. Also, the proposed technology will make use of natural pigments such as hemp, coffee, and algae, which may contribute to sustainability. Unlike trimmings and embellishments made from petroleum-based plastics, these products are expected to cause little harm to the environment when eventually discarded. While chemical dyes commonly found in plastic trimmings and embellishments have been found to be harmful to the environment, the proposed natural pigments are not expected to cause damage during the biodegradation process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
