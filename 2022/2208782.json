 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses detailed fieldwork with native speakers to study the factors that influence word choices in how speakers convey information about what they do and do not know in an understudied and endangered language. While speakers of all languages make these choices, addressing this question in an endangered and less studied language is important for two reasons: 1) understanding the choices that speakers of different languages make is key to identifying universal patterns across languages, and 2) this language has many features that are not common across languages, which make it a useful testing ground for current linguistic theories.\r\n\r\nThe research involves three case studies exploring the structure and meaning of verbs like 'think' and 'say', words that translate as both 'might' and 'must', and questions that imply that the speaker already knows the answer. In all of these cases, speakers must choose to use one particular word or sentence type over another, which often has implications that go beyond the literal meaning of the sentence. This type of research is difficult to conduct in understudied languages, since it requires a basic knowledge of the language's syntax and semantics, to which this project also contributes. The research will be based on interviews with native speakers, as well as oral narratives and conversations between speakers. In addition to advancing linguistic theory, this project contributes to the creation of language materials for the community, including an online \"living dictionary\" containing practical words and phrases with corresponding audio recordings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
