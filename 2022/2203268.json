 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gulf of Mexico supports a wide array of habitats, from wetlands to reefs that maintain high levels of biodiversity, estimated at over 15,000 species; with up to 20% unknown to science.  The lack of biodiversity knowledge is significant in the context of this region with frequent hurricanes and human influences, like oil spills, that can impact and often interrupt valuable ecosystem services, including fisheries. Since its founding in 1980, Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) has built a marine biodiversity collection over well over 15,000 specimens representing over 500 species.  This valuable research and education resource is of value for assessing impacts to the Gulf of Mexico including coastal loss, hurricanes, and oil spills. It represents a substantial set of marine and coastal collections, especially for invertebrates, for the Louisiana coast. The Louisiana portion of the Gulf coast is unique.  It is affected by the Mississippi River outflow, extensive wetland systems, the Dead Zone, and human influences due to the higher concentrations of oil and gas refineries and wells. It is also a region affected by severe storms, including hurricanes.  And due to building damage during Hurricane Ida, the collections at LUMCON are at risk.\r\n \r\nThis proposal seeks to secure LUMCON\u2019s natural history collections for future research and education. Specifically, the project will secure curatorial staff to aid in conservatory efforts, relocate and secure LUMCON\u2019s natural history collections in a new location, and assess the condition of the current collection and develop and implement a cataloging system to facilitate and inform the strategy for growing the collection. In addition, the project will create a paid minority summer internship program based on collections research. The student will train on collections-based research and learn museum collections methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The new collections space is a front-facing and easily accessible component of LUMCON&rsquo;s new Blue Works facility with external displays describing what a scientific collection is and LUMCON&rsquo;s collections history as well highlighting commercially important invertebrate species, the influence of Cajun French on species names, invertebrate dry specimens, and rare and anomalous specimens.&nbsp; The collection specimens are now housed in rolling collections shelves to maximize efficiency of space and access. &nbsp;Some images of the new collections space are included.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to the relocation, the LUMCON collection specimens were assessed and viable specimens were re-jarred and information was verified and/or updated. In total, LUMCON staff now has detailed and digitized information on 1,552 of these jars, while the remaining 225 have incomplete label information and/or are waiting to be fully digitized. Our digital database contains 1,962 unique records. The wet collections, which include the jars relocated from Cocodrie to Houma, contain 1,828 unique records. We do not have confirmed physical presence of 276 of these records, a loss of 15%. These jars may have been lost while the collection was not actively managed, or some of them may be in the jars with incomplete label information. We will continue to address these differences between our digital records and our physical holdings. The wet collections contain 721 invertebrate records representing 12 phyla and 357 species along with 1,107 vertebrate records representing one phylum, six classes, and 285 species. The botany collection consists of 50 plant specimens representing 40 species. The Oyster Reef Biodiversity Collection contains 84 records, each of a unique taxon with representatives from seven phyla and 12 classes. Combined, our collections have over 700 species.</p>\r\n<p>We achieved other project goals through initially hiring a collections technician that oversaw the assessment, re-jarring, and relocation of the specimens. Towards the completion of the grant, LUMCON hired a collections manager with the goal of maintaining and continuing to grow the collections. The long-term goal is to more fully integrate the collections program into LUMCON&rsquo;s education &amp; outreach and research activities. Each of these collections program employees mentored an undergraduate student for a summer research experience, resulting in two projects carried out involving natural history collections. We also promoted and publicized the collections to create broader awareness of its availability as a resource for understanding local marine biodiversity. We conducted activities at three public open house events, were part of multiple facility tours, and gave two research seminars, one for scientists and one for the general public the latter of which can be seen on LUMCON&rsquo;s YouTube page.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/13/2024<br>\nModified by: Brian&nbsp;J&nbsp;Roberts</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
