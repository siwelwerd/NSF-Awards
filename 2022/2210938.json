 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs request EAGER funding to test the feasibility of making undersea observations of seismic and oceanic processes across ocean basins on existing telecommunications cables. The project will provide partial support for two graduate students  \r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to compare three fiber-optical methods, Ultra-stable Laser Interferometry (ULI), Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and a long-range polarization-based method simultaneously on a telecom cable on the seafloor of Puget Sound, in Saratoga Passage, between Whidbey and Camano Island. The physics linking geophysics and ULI signals and other new techniques, like Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and the new long-range polarization-based method is limited and needs to be investigated further. There haven\u2019t been field demonstrations showing the potential capability to resolve signals from earthquakes, tidal signals, or whale vocalizations. The current installation gives the PIs an ideal opportunity to compare the three fiber-optical methods simultaneously on a single cable with individual seismic signals arriving at various angles and varying tidal currents. These measurements would provide the first data on relative sensitivities and provide preliminary data to support future NSF proposals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have developed high accuracy measurement systems based on a laser that has a precisely-defined and stable wavelength (frequency).  By using that advanced laser, combined with electronics, and using existing optical fiber networks that are already deployed for communication systems we are able to precisely measure the motion of the Earth and ocean.  Field tests were completed in Puget Sound using one optical fiber on land and another optical fiber on a 4 km path under Puget sound.  We compared three different methods for detecting Earth-ocean changes and motion.  The results reveal key information about the Earth-ocean dynamics on both short and long time scales, that includes measurements of: solid earth tides, ocean tides, sediment transport, Earthquakes, as well as average tempurature changes at the bottom of the Puget Sound.  This approach can be a powerful and valuable method for understanding motions and dynamics of the Earth-ocean system and also monitoring for major distruptions and human hazards (Earthquakes, Tsunamis, etc.  Taking advantage of existing optical fiber networks, this approach could be deployed worldwide for basic science in understanding Earth and oceans and in locations that are most critical for infrastructure and human safety.  In our controlled lab setting we have also developed new techniques that can provide additional capabilities such as improved localization and faster detection bandwidths to deployed optical fiber networks and sensors. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leo Hollberg"
