 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). PI Biji Wong is awarded a National Science Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Wong supports the research project entitled \"MPS-Ascend: Topics in Low-Dimensional Topology and Heegaard Floer Theory,\" under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Duke University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Adam Levine.\r\n\r\nBuilding on her prior research, the PI plans to use bordered Floer theory to study sliceness of satellite knots as well as categorification of invariants of three-orbifolds. Other projects include using Heegaard Floer homology to understand double covers of the three-sphere branched over links and generalization of the slice-ribbon conjecture in the setting of links. To broaden participation, the PI plans to collaboratively set up virtual Directed Reading Programs at HBCUs, including North Carolina Central University, help organize a mentoring cluster for minority women mathematicians in the North Carolina area, and form partnerships with the Math Alliance network as well as R1 mathematics departments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
