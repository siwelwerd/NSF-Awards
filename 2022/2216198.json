 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation Award is for a comprehensive x-ray scattering system, which will transform the research, educational, and outreach activities across California\u2019s Central Valley. This state-of-the-art instrument serves as a flagship tool for the Advanced Materials Characterization and Testing Laboratory at the University of California, Davis, addressing the needs of a broad range of users from local community colleges, research institutions, national laboratories, and industry. The study of the atomic structure of advanced materials as well as their evolution upon exposure to external forces enables these researchers to design new materials that solve pressing problems in the information technology, renewable energy, and environment sectors. Furthermore, access to this instrument creates opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in cutting-edge research and will modernize the science and engineering curricula by providing hands-on learning experiences and incorporating groundbreaking research results into coursework. These activities are key to bolstering student retention and promoting interest in science and technology careers, particularly among underrepresented minorities, women, and first-generation college students. \r\n\r\nMajor research areas enabled by this system include quantum materials, energy conversion/storage materials, amorphous materials, and biomaterials. This versatile system has measurement capabilities for high-resolution x-ray diffraction, x-ray reflectivity, reciprocal space maps, and small/wide angle x-ray scattering measurements applied to powders, thin films, and nanomaterials. Moreover, the system hosts in situ capabilities consisting of temperature and environment-controlled sample stages, and an enclosure large enough to support ancillary equipment for the application of electric fields and laser illumination. These features are directly relevant to topics such as (a) the interplay between magnetic, electronic, and structural properties of quantum materials, (b) synthesis, characterization, and theoretical analysis of inorganic nanoparticles for energy conversion/storage devices, (c) structural analysis of catalysts and establishment of structure-catalytic properties relationships, (d) disorder, defects, and molecular structure of thin films for biosensors, (e) materials under extreme conditions, and (f) interfacial and bio-geo-chemical processes, which are critical to the transport of contaminants in the environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
