 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student for select students participating in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning (LPNMR) that will be held in Genova Nervi, Italy, September 5-8, 2022. This is a well-established international conference that facilitates interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and researchers who work in the areas of knowledge representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage. The DMC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines. This event provides students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research and enables them to explore their career objectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
