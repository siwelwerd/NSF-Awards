 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF project aims to incorporate the physical modeling of the electric grid in the theory of machine learning algorithms, to benefit the monitoring and control of energy delivery systems. While the basic theory we will develop applies broadly to transmission and distribution systems, the section of the grid we are focusing on is the one that is undergoing the greatest transformation, which is the distribution grid. This section of the system not only poses unique modeling challenges, it is also undergoing significant changes because of the integration of distributed energy resources and the control of responsive demand and storage. These are the key ingredients to sustainable energy delivery, and the project will bring transformative changes to the digital technology and machine intelligence that can accelerate this transition.  \r\n\r\nMore specifically, the proposal explores a novel mathematical approach for the analysis of grid signals, rooted in fundamental power systems graph-based methods and born out of interpreting the system state as an instance of graph signals. The goal is to use the insights that come from Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and from graph Fourier analysis, to extract signals features that allow to improve data driven inference and decision algorithms. At this time, GSP machine learning tools are designed for real signals and are not physics based. The project will fill this gap, by providing the underpinning for a theory of grid graph signals. This entails extending the GSP tools to tackle complex signals, incorporating the grid system parameters in the algorithm and considering realistic power measurements systems. The goal is to have a better representation of the spatial-temporal characteristics of the data as compared to generic machine learning algorithms and advance the theoretical tools in GSP which are not based on systems whose properties are captures by the signals envelopes and on the physics of the grid. The tools developed will be made available open source. In addition to the advances in GSP, the project will have broader impact through its outreach to New York City public schools and create a short program for K-12 students, supported by an illustrated book, explaining how energy is delivered and the path that advanced societies need to follow to achieve the goal of a decarbonized economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
