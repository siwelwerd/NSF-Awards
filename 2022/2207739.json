 "awd_abstract_narration": "As emerging contaminants, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances make up a large group of persistent anthropogenic chemicals that are persistent and not easily degradable in the environment and in the human body. Due to their impact on human health, the exposure health advisory of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate in drinking water is recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency to be no more than 70 parts per trillion. Measurements at such low concentration require ultrasensitivity. This project will illustrate how nanotechnology and sensing technology can be meshed together for ultrasensitive detection of those substances. The work will revolutionize the atomic layer deposition-enabled molecular sensing platform if successful. The outcome will not only have an enormous impact on environmental monitoring and public health, but also provide a demonstration from basic science to applications. This project will also involve the students at all levels and integrate advanced device fabrication and sensing knowledge into their education and research training. The research results will be disseminated to general public and industry companies. \r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary project aims at developing a novel, simple, portable, low-cost sensor for rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances based on unique atomic layer deposition-enabled molecularly imprinting technology and ultrasensitive electrochemical signal detection in a portable platform. Several novel features crossing nano-, material- and sensing technologies will be seamlessly integrated into the sensing platform. After validation of the sensing device using spiked water samples in the controlled laboratory environment, the devices will be applied for in-field tests of river water samples. In addition, this new methodology is naturally not limited to any particular small molecules. Therefore, it can be generalized as a universal platform for monitoring a wide spectrum of small molecules of interest after molecularly imprinting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
