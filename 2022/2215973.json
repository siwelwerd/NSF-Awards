 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The University of Rochester is acquiring a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer with a liquid nitrogen cooled probe to support the research of Professor Alison Frontier and colleagues Rudi Fasan, Caitlyn R. Kennedy, and Shauna M. Paradine. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of synthesis, peptide chemistry, catalysis, and materials chemistry. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The nitrogen-cooled probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in the department. Accessibility of the instrument to science and engineering students promotes their training for future careers.\r\n\r\nThe award of the 500 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry, polymer science, biochemistry, and biophysics. This instrument enables research focused on the synthesis of complex natural products and other biologically relevant polycycles, catalytic methods for asymmetric synthesis, C-H functionalization of bioactive molecules, and transition metal catalyzed C-C bond formation.  It also assists in the preparation of molecular mimics of inorganic and hybrid porous materials and in the dehydrogenation and dehydration of alcohols and amines. Other investigations include the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of polyoxovanadate-alkoxide clusters and using iron-catalyzed transformations in organic synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
