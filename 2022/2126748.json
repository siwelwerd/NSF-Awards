 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to accelerate and improve the development and optimization of enzyme products.  This project will develop a platform that reduces costs and delays associated with research.  These enzyme products will improve the cost, safety, and sustainability in a range of applications, such as biomass processing, animal nutrition, solid and liquid waste management, household and industrial cleaners, and enzyme replacement therapies.  This solution will support the growth of the $10 billion enzyme market.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will advance a fluorescence-based enzyme activity-sensing platform, by reducing barriers to development of new industrial biocatalysts, enabling the rapid design of hydrolytic enzymes for industrial and specialty markets through the development of modular enzyme activity probes. The technical hurdles addressed by the proposed research and development are (1) determining performance metrics (limits of detection, speed, accuracy) relative to existing characterization techniques, (2) determining effects of sensor preparation methods on sensor performance, and (3) developing a robust reader for field use. The goals of the proposed research and development are to (1) provide parity data to current assays for end-users to engender confidence in our approach, (2) standardize production protocol, and (3) provide hand-held reader that is inexpensive (<$3000) and can withstand rough handling in field. At a high level, these goals will be achieved by (1) testing our sensors on a panel of candidate enzymes that have rigorous characterization already (to establish performance metrics), (2) using designed experiments to screen process space of sensor preparation and model effect on sensor performance attributes, and (3) using a design-build-test engineering framework to test reader components and layout.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite the efforts to develop new biocatalysts to meet sustainability metrics, the critical quality of enzyme activity remains difficult to evaluate. Existing methods rely on either multi-step byproduct assays, structurally dissimilar colorogenic substrates, or complex enzymatic pathways, all which trade between accuracy and ease of use.\n\nZymosense Inc develops optical probes and assay kits to measure the activity of manufactured and endogenous enzymes important to agriculture, industry, and human health.  This technology achieves a unique combination of accuracy and ease of use by using fluorescent nanoparticles which are functionalized with enzyme substrates, rendering them sensitive to enzymatic modification.  This simple sensor design allows for rapid development of activity probes for new target enzymes.\n\nThrough this SBIR project, we have successfully demonstrated feasibility of this assaying platform.  In Phase I, we validated a panel of enzyme probes including sensors for protease, cellulase, and amylase.  These probes featured a broad dynamic range and demonstrated close parity with existing enzyme assays.  Routes to improve sensor stability and sensitivity were identified and will be further pursued as we expand our library of sensors.\n\nBecause Zymosense probes fluoresce in the NIR region, which lies outside the range of sensitivity of most silicon photodetectors, they require specialized optical detectors for use of the enzyme probes.  Within this Phase I project, we have designed, prototyped, and tested complementary portable cuvette- and well plate-reading fluorimeters.  These readers have been drop-tested, splash-tested, and tested at customer locations to ensure out-of-the-box functionality.  These fluorimeters were demonstrated to be cost-effective and portable, allowing for onsite sensor demonstration and use.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathaniel Kallmyer"
