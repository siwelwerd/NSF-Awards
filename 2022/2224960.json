 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Quantum Technologies (CQT) is a partnership between Purdue University, Indiana University (Bloomington and Indiana University Purdue University - Indianapolis Campuses), and the University of Notre Dame. The mission of the CQT is to collaborate with industry and government stakeholders to identify compelling needs and challenges in quantum technologies, and then develop novel solutions to address these opportunities. Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the participating universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe overarching vision of the CQT is to bring together multidisciplinary experts in academia, industry, and government in a self-sustaining, collaborative venture facilitating the transition of fundamental research discoveries in quantum science and engineering to novel, commercial-ready technologies. Specifically, it will focus on three significant industrial and government interests: quantum computing (including simulation and algorithm development), quantum sensing, and quantum communications. Purdue will tackle these areas using its expertise in quantum algorithm development and machine learning, quantum devices and materials, quantum nanophotonics,  condensed-matter physics, and quantum chemistry. The technologies developed in the CQT could help save energy, speed up computation, enhance national security and defense, and innovate health care. Indeed, potential applications range from improving traffic flow to securing banking to speeding and optimizing material and drug designs to improve military capabilities. A variety of world-class facilities are available on the Purdue campus to support the CQT. These include the Birck Nanotechnology Center, which houses a 25,000 sq. ft. clean room and has a multitude of experimental capabilities including nanofabrication, materials and surface characterization and microscopy, quantum design physical property measurement system, and optical characterization laboratories. The Physics Department also houses a crystal growth facility, various portable radioactive sources to test for radiation fidelity, machine and electronic shops, and a helium re-capture and re-liquification system, which significantly reduces costs of running cryogenic equipment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
