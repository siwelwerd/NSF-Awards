 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to bring to market a novel self-buoyant panel that will enable floating photovoltaics (FPV) to play an important role in achieving the Nation\u2019s clean energy goals. The Federal Solar Futures Study describes a goal to generate over 40% of the nation\u2019s electricity using solar, which would require a 10x increase.  However, this would require 10 million acres by 2050 \u2013 an area larger than New Jersey. FPV systems can directly mitigate land displacement. According to NREL, the 24,419 US bodies of water have a technical potential of over 300 GW. The barrier to scaling deployments is the cost premium of the artificial island needed to support panels, which can increase system costs by 30% compared to ground-mounted utility scale solar arrays.  The proposed solar panel design floats uses sealed photovoltaic (PV) glass tubes and no mounting hardware to solve the cost premium.  Further, the PV tubes track the sun like 1-axis trackers, but with no moving parts, to increase energy yield by 10-20%.  These systems could become the cheapest form of solar.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the key barriers to commercialization of the proposed FPV technology. Realizing the market and impact potential of this solution requires retiring multiple risks and achieving several milestones that are address in the proposed project. The company will refine and test functional tubes that are hermetically sealed at the ends to maintain floatation and protect the solar cells.  The company will team with one of the premier US marine renewable energy research institutions, to study multiple aspects of the design. First, the project will focus on a robust structural system that meets operating requirements. The project will research using simulation tools the mooring system and panel configurations needed for a range of wave and wind conditions. Additionally, a key element of a self-buoyant approach requires knowledge of potential biological factors that can impact solar production and panel performance. Accordingly, this investigation will also study the potential effects of biofilms and other environmental factors on PV tubes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe primary goal was to prove that Sunspans photovoltaic tubes can survive while floating in water for an extended period. This investigation was successful in meeting this objective and the company will apply for a Phase 2 grant.\n\n\nThe company first made two panels by combining 6 photovoltaic tubes. These were installed in Newport, OR. One was in a saltwater tank for ease of monitoring and the other was in Yaquina Bay (Figure 1). Both panels floated successfully for 6 months.\n\n\nPerformance testing of tubes showed that they have sun tracking behavior analogous to 1 axis trackers, but with no moving parts (Figure 2). Comparison of the Taka panels (which lie completely flat) was against a fixed standard solar panel tilted to the south at 10 degrees.\n\n\nReliability testing was performed at the Renewable Energy Test Center in Fremont, CA. Multiple tubes were fully hermetic even under 85C/85% humidity conditions and our design survived Level 1 and Level 2 hail testing. While generally successful, the reliability tests did indicate several areas where improvements are needed to meet long-term performance requirements. Taka has redesigned several internal features of the solar tubes to avoid future issues.\n\n\nSimulations of the flexible panel design were performed at Oregon State University to understand survivability under wave action, such as in the open ocean. Results indicated that with a correctly engineered mooring system, the panels can successfully survive up to Sea State 6 (4-6 meter wave heights). Figure 3 shows the panel with its mooring system.\n\n\nLastly, researchers at the Hatfield Marine Science Laboratory in Newport, OR tested the growth of organisms on the tubes. While algae did grow on the undersides of the tubes, none appeared above the water line and the biofouling is expected to have no effect on energy generation (Figure 4). Detailed sub-reports on the simulations and biofouling studies were produced as part of the study.\n\n\nThe Phase 1 study demonstrated the full feasibility of Takas unique self-buoyant panel design and ability to deploy in a wide range of marine conditions. In a Phase 2 study, the company would test larger panels using the improved design in multiple environments that are commercially relevant, as well as test for longer durations (over a year) to support future industry adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherDBarnes\n"
