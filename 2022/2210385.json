 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a novel method of drying agricultural products that is more energy efficient than current commercial devices and preserves the nutritional value of the dried products. This project is based upon  fast dehydration of wet biomass using desiccants comprised of particles of a certain size and arrangement. According to preliminary trials, this method may be 10 times more energy efficient than other drying methods. This project will produce a reusable particle filter that can be used to efficiently dehydrate food and agricultural products. This drying method can preserve nutritional value within the US food system while simultaneously reducing production costs, make agricultural industries more economically viable, and be easily powered by renewable energy sources thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption within the food industry.\r\n\r\nThe technical innovation of this STTR Phase I project is the development of efficient and effective drying methods for agricultural products.  The technology is based on the incorporation of zeolite particles onto a substrate while maintaining their porosity. In order to achieve rapid dehydration of wet matter, the zeolite must be small in size and supported on a substrate so that its surface retains functionality. This methodology requires careful chemical synthesis. The key research goals are to conjugate or physically bind zeolite particles to a porous substrate, maintain the accessible surface area of the zeolite, and create a new material that can endure many cycles of brief low-power microwave heating to accomplish dehydration. In this project, several approaches will be investigated, starting with the synthesis of porous substrates, then modifying the surface to contain a controlled number of chemical functional groups, and then coating the substrate with zeolite using covalent linkages. In addition to covalent monolayer linkages, the project will also aim to optimize substrate coverage using other binding mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
