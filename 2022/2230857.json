 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of electric motors for higher torque position control actuators used in robotic and industrial automation systems. The worldwide market for position control actuators is forecast to reach $16 billion by 2026. This market growth is associated with the transition to Industry 4.0 methods that seek improved efficiency and faster adaptation to variable market demands by developing streamlined processes in product development and delivery technologies. Achieving the benefits of Industry 4.0 practices involves extensive use of advanced electric motor controls and actuators to connect manufacturing systems through digital communication networks. In addition, the electrification of transportation systems such as autonomous vehicles, electric aircraft, and railways are further increasing the demand for position control actuators and their associated control electronics. The proposed technology may increase the ability of industries to expand manufacturing capacity in the US. Further, electric motor actuators may enable a much larger increase in economic development associated with emerging markets for advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, aircraft, and transportation electrification.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of copper additive manufacturing technologies that enable the design of new types of electrical machinery including electric motor position control actuators. These types of actuators are used for precise control of position, velocity and acceleration in robotics and industrial automation equipment. The designs enabled by the proposed copper additive manufacturing allows sensor and electronic control functions to be integrated into a single modular device. In addition, the proposed technology provides greater than 40% more torque and power density compared to existing electrical actuators, eliminates cables and wiring between electric motor actuators and control electronics by integrating these into a single assembly, and eliminates separate position sensing devices using magnetic and electrical structures that provide dual functionality of torque production with position and velocity sensing. These proposed features may result in reduced size and weight while achieving increased reliability in extreme temperature, vibration, and liquid environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
