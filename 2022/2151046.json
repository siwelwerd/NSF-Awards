 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need for high-quality mathematics and science teachers who also have knowledge and certification to teach computer science, addressing serious shortages in the United States STEM teaching force. The unique contribution of this graduate program will be to combine a field-embedded introduction to ambitious STEM instruction with extensive pedagogical content knowledge in computer science education, producing highly qualified mathematics and science teachers who can also teach computer science courses in high-need schools. Graduates of the program will complete requirements for middle and secondary level teacher certification in mathematics or science and requirements for computer science education certification. Graduates will then serve as teachers in high-need schools, equipped with pedagogical skills and qualifications in computer science and mathematics or science, and prepared with a highly desirable combination of skills to serve in high-need environments. \r\n\r\nThis project at Marquette University includes partnerships with Milwaukee Public Schools, Milwaukee area charter schools, the Shorewood School District, and schools in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. Project goals include recruiting 24 highly qualified STEM professionals and preparing them to enter high-need school environments with a Master of Education and teacher certifications. The project will develop a multimodal (in person and online) pathway that will lead to computer science teacher certification alongside mathematics or science teacher certification. The project is theoretically grounded in practice-based teacher preparation, ambitious instruction, and pedagogical content knowledge for computer science instruction. In keeping with current reforms in K-12 STEM education and teacher education, ambitious instruction supports all students, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, and identity, in rigorous and conceptual learning of STEM content. Additionally, the project will support graduates in their early professional practice. Research questions will address effective pedagogies for developing ambitious teaching practices in mathematics, science, and computer science, particularly focused on pedagogies of enactment and scholar development of ambitious teaching across STEM fields through qualitative and observational research methods. The project will contribute to the empirical knowledge base by advancing intersectional research on computer science education, ambitious STEM instruction, and practice-based teacher preparation. The main impact of the project is to improve the quality of STEM instruction and expand computer science programs in area secondary high-need schools. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
