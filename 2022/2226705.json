 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for students to attend the 2022 Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium \u2013 An Additive Manufacturing Conference to be held 25-27 July 2022, in Austin, Texas. The symposium focuses on new research and development activities in additive manufacturing and 3D printing. The students and faculty present through oral and poster sessions their latest research results to the additive manufacturing, advanced manufacturing and broader engineering communities. Priority is given to students who are women or who come from underrepresented minority groups. This approach promotes diverse participation at the conference, in the short term, and in STEM fields, in the long term. This award benefits the nation through the education of a skilled and diverse manufacturing workforce, which is better prepared to provide transformative solutions the challenges in their chosen fields. The conference plays an important role in supporting and sustaining the important field of additive manufacturing/3D printing, a technology that is pervasive and impacts across all industrial sectors with benefits to society. This conference is timely because of renewed interest in the U.S in onshoring advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis participant support is expected to benefit the students' professional, scientific and technical development. Attendance at the conference gives the students and faculty a broader view of solid freeform fabrication, additive manufacturing and additive/subtractive hybrid processes, its fundamentals, advanced materials and processing, advanced characterization and applications. Symposium topics include fundamentals of additive materials, additive process development, microstructural analysis, process modeling, monitoring and control, and specialized topics, such as Hybrid Additive Manufacturing Processes.  Attendees will learn about state-of-the-art research in their technical areas via access to several technical and professional development talks by leading domestic and international speakers. Students and young faculty enhance their communication skills through oral and poster presentations and in-depth discussions of their work with peers in their technical areas. This interactive experience significantly broadens student education, increases their enthusiasm for their research topic, acquaints them with expectations for scientific careers, and exposes them to new approaches for innovative research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
