 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in comprehensively addressing issues related to water treatment, environment protection, and resource recovery through the development of a new desalination technology called a desalination battery. Steady growth in human population and rapid industrial development have led to greater demands for clean water production. At the same time, anthropogenic activities, agricultural practices, and the disposal of wastewater have led to the salinization of natural freshwater resources. The desalination battery combines the functions of desalination and energy generation to reduce the energy and costs associated with desalination, addressing challenges at the intersection of the water-energy nexus. The goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the commercialization of the desalination battery by evaluating the effects of various solution components present in real feedwater types on performance. The project will also establish mitigation plans for problematic solution components. Successful development of the desalination battery will help to safeguard access to freshwater resources and ensure an adequate water supply, which are essential to advance the health and welfare of the American public. Commercialization of the proposed technology will also create jobs for researchers and engineers making a positive economic impact.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this STTR project is to further develop a new desalination technology, a desalination battery, which is based on the patented use of bismuth (Bi) as a chloride (Cl)-storage electrode in combination with a sodium (Na)-storage electrode. The desalination battery stores and releases energy during the charging and discharging processes. These processes are coupled with the storage and release of Na+ and Cl-. As the energy consumed during charging is recovered during discharging, the net energy required for desalination is drastically reduced. Furthermore, since Na+ and Cl- are removed via ion-specific electrode reactions, it enables membrane-free desalination. While efficient removal of NaCl has been demonstrated, the effects of various other solution components present in real wastewater and seawater are still unknown. The goal of the proposed work is to accurately evaluate the effects of different salinities, pH conditions, and various inorganic and organic species present in real feedwater on the performance of the desalination battery. The project will also develop mitigation plans for any problematic solution components. Accurate technoeconomic calculations will be used to prioritize the most promising feedwater targets and to develop a tailored commercialization plan for specific applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At the same time, pervasive drought conditions, anthropogenic activities (e.g., road salt), agricultural practices, and the disposal of wastewater effluent have led to salinization of natural freshwater resources. Dissolved salt contains Cl&#713;, which is harmful to freshwater aquatic species, threatens the availability of drinking water, and is notoriously difficult to remove from water. To manage concerns about increasing Cl&#713; concentrations, regulators have imposed Cl&#713; limits for municipal and industrial wastewater dischargers. As the long-term consequences of Cl&#713; discharge have become better understood, regulations have also gotten stricter. The treatment technologies currently available for Cl&#713; removal are reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis (ED), and thermal evaporation.

Non-selective ion removal increases the cost and makes these processes ill-suited to Cl&#713; removal from wastewater.
