 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Contamination of groundwater by poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is increasingly recognized as a major environmental issue. Sometimes called \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d these compounds bioaccumulate, can cause adverse health outcomes, and are difficult to break down. Plasma technologies offer promising avenues to remediation, especially via the production of free electrons dissolved in water (\u201csolvated electrons\u201d). This award supports Dr. Light at Colorado College in a project to study the production of solvated electrons by atmospheric pressure plasma. The award will also provide the resources to involve a significant number of undergraduates from minoritized backgrounds in cutting edge research through a \u201cresearch incubator\u201d course and funded summer research positions.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe overarching goal of this research program in the next five to ten years is to understand the physics and chemistry involved in using low-temperature plasma (LTP) to break apart and extract  recalcitrant contaminants from water.  The project seeks to measure the time-dependent concentration of solvated electrons  at the water\u2019s surface by adapting an existing spectroscopic technique. Supercontinuum transient absorption spectroscopy is a well-established method for studying time-resolved chemical and physical processes, but it has not yet been applied to LTP or to the plasma/water interface. The development of this diagnostic would open new avenues for time-resolved studies of LTP and of the chemistry they drive. The proposed study will also illuminate the landscape of atmospheric pressure plasma jets as sources for solvated electrons, yield information about what plasma parameters are important to the process, and guide efforts to optimize plasma sources for remediation applications. This award funds a pilot \u201cresearch incubator\u201d course designed for first- and second-year students from underrepresented backgrounds in order to lower the entry barrier into undergraduate research positions. The course will run twice during the grant period, with a cap of ten students each time. The award also establishes six dedicated research stipends for low-income, minoritized, and first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
