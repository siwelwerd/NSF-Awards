 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award will focus on collecting and processing high resolution, perishable data on the spatial distribution of erosive and depositional patterns in the vicinity of infrastructure and river sections that were affected during the 2021 Western European Floods. These data will be interrogated to provide insight into how channel geometry, flow conditions, the presence of debris, and geotechnical properties affect performance of engineered structures interacting with extreme floods. This is relevant in the context of global climate change where extreme flooding is expected to occur more frequently and at larger magnitudes. Many of the modern structures that were damaged during the flooding in Germany are similar to structures found across the United States and knowledge gained from studying this flooding event will be transferable to the built environment in the United States. Data generated during the project can provide support to update infrastructure design and flood mitigation strategies to meet future demands intensified by climate change.\r\n\r\nThe specific goal of this research is to provide new data and knowledge on the impact of extreme flooding events on infrastructure and the effects of urban land usage and environmental conditions. Through this data collection, a detailed set of case studies that document sediment dynamics in the vicinity of infrastructure and in urban river sections will facilitate identification of features and processes that potentially influence performance of engineered structures during extreme flooding. Geophysical field measurements in the riverbed will include rotary side scan sonar, high resolution chirp sonar, and single beam sonar. This will enable collection of channel bathymetry and sediment stratigraphy, which may reveal novel information on if or how changes in substrata in the upper meter of the river bed play a significant role in sediment mobilization and instability during extreme hydraulic events. Both ground-based and airborne LiDAR surveys will provide high-resolution, 3D models of the riverbanks and surrounding structures, enabling assessment of potential interaction between erosive patterns and structural damage. Multispectral images will be collected using drone-based technology to identify broader erosive and depositional patterns. Geotechnical field measurements will include pocket free fall penetrometer, pocket erodometer, field vane shear, and field fall cone measurements in addition to sample collection for laboratory measurements. The geotechnical observations, coupled with the geophysical and remote sensing data, will enable a comprehensive assessment of how sediments were eroded and transported near engineered structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, water-soil-infrastructure-debris interactions are often complex, and for extreme flood events, often unprecedented, leading to current knowledge gaps in our understanding of infrastructure system performance during extreme flood events. Furthermore, access restrictions and safety concerns when collecting data with more traditional methods have limited data collection efforts during and shortly after significant flood events, leading to data gaps hampering the development of new and updated knowledge. This project aimed at addressing the issue of existing data gaps by collecting perishable data after flood events in the Ahr Valley, Germany in 2021 and in the Yellowstone River Paradise Valley, Montana in 2022. State-of-the-art measuring instrumentation including remote sensing, autonomy, and in-water sensors were leveraged to collect a unique data set of seamless riverbed to riverbanks information of topography, morphology, soil conditions, infrastructure damage, and the presence of debris at ten selected locations. Each location was different regarding local geomorphology and geology, infrastructure systems, impact from the flood, and soil conditions, and was chosen based on those characteristics as well as accessibility and status of damage and repairs.</p>\n<p>The field data collection was completed in 2022 at all ten locations. Field data sets were complemented by publicly available data from local water gages and satellite imagery. The collected data allow a full insight into topography and bathymetry as well as soil type and conditions maps for all ten locations tested. It also shows the infrastructure system in its environmental setting, damage condition, and interaction with debris. The seamless riverbed to riverbanks data sets allow the reconstruction of localized erosion and sediment deposition patterns during the flood event. High resolution data collected was found of suitable quality to develop full models of the case studies. Initial data processing as part of this project has already pointed at the relevance of local geomorphology and geomorphodynamics as a key factor governing flood water - infrastructure - soil interaction to the extend of creating weak spots that have not been considered during the design of this aging infrastructure. Data assessment also provided lessons learned on best practices in data collection using combined remotely sensed, autonomy, terrestrial and underwater technology in flood reconnaissance data collection.</p>\n<p>The new data sets will spark new research that will provide new knowledge into how extreme flooding events impact infrastructure and how they are affected by urban land usage and environmental conditions. This is especially relevant in the context of global climate change where extreme loading is expected to occur more frequently and at larger magnitudes.</p>\n<p>The project strengthened domestic and international collaborations between a diverse and multi-disciplinary team of flood disaster researchers. Results have been disseminated through expert research conferences and journals as well as reports and a webinar to a broader audience of academic and governmental researchers as well as practitioners. Data were also shared with local stakeholders for immediate support of local decision making and planning. Multiple graduate students were trained through this project and had the opportunity to expand their professional network and international experiences through collaboration with the project team. Data sets are shared publicly through DesignSafe-CI and initial data reports are available through the GEER (Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance) association.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/09/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nina&nbsp;Stark</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2213715/2213715_10793970_1686341031778_IMG-20220329-WA0006--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2213715/2213715_10793970_1686341031778_IMG-20220329-WA0006--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Side scan sonar scanning at damaged pedestrian bridge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2213715/2213715_10793970_1686341031778_IMG-20220329-WA0006--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Side scan sonar scanning at damaged pedestrian bridge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Upstream view of the \ufffdpink\ufffd pedestrian bridge in Mayschoss during GEER phase 2 (March 2022) during side scan sonar imaging of debris-riverbed contact.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nina Stark</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nina&nbsp;Stark</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Side scan sonar scanning at damaged pedestrian bridge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2213715/2213715_10793970_1686341264956_M1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2213715/2213715_10793970_1686341264956_M1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bathymetry embedded in DEM model in Mayschoss\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2213715/2213715_10793970_1686341264956_M1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bathymetry embedded in DEM model in Mayschoss\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bathymetry measured by the Z-boat set within a terrestrial model obtained from UAV imagery.
