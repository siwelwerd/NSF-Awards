 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant will enable students in US universities to participate in the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, CIKM 2022, which will be hybrid with an in-person meeting in Atlanta, GA, USA, October 17-22, 2022. This proposal will enable US-based students to travel to Atlanta to participate in the conference and its associated workshops. CIKM will feature selected high-quality technical papers with broad international participation and will include multiple keynotes, an industry day with technical talks from industry,tutorials, workshops, and a PhD symposium. The funding will be used primarily to defray the costs of registration, travel, and lodging for the students. It will enable a life-enriching first-time experience for many students, giving them a taste for the research environment in both academic and industrial circles around the world.\r\n\r\nCIKM provides a unique interdisciplinary forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and initiatives. Efforts will be made to engage students with a view towards broadening the participation of researchers from women and other underrepresented groups. The conference will contribute directly to training the next generation of scientists who are both consumers and developers of technology in information and knowledge management. The grant will have a direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce who can take on the emerging data science challenges of the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
