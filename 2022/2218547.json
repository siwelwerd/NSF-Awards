 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the Advancing Geochronology Science, Spaces, and Systems (AGeS-cubed or AGeS3) initiative to: (1) increase access to geochronology data and geochronology expertise to further our understanding of unified Earth systems, (2) implement a platform attracting underrepresented minorities to the geosciences, and (3) test grassroots ideas at a frontier of inclusive and collaborative science. Geochronology data provide the temporal information required for synergistic science spanning the deep Earth to surface processes. Yet National Academy reports have repeatedly highlighted challenges for geochronology data access, technical innovation, and training. This project addresses these needs through a trio of strategic micro-award programs. The mature AGeS-Grad program supports high-impact collaborative science projects between graduate students, labs, and home institution mentors. The prototype AGeS-DiG (Diversity in Geochronology) program funds pilot initiatives to increase access to geochronology for those underrepresented in the Earth sciences. The new AGeS-TRaCE (Training and Community Engagement) program supports community-led efforts to address emerging challenges in geochronology. The micro-awards of this program powers the human infrastructure engine, enabling important scientific advances that may not happen within the silo of more classic grants.\r\n\r\nThe Advancing Geochronology Science, Spaces, and Systems (AGeS-cubed or AGeS3) project builds on the success and cooperative spirit of the AGeS-Grad subprogram through the launch of micro-grant opportunities to crowd-source solutions for self-identified geochronology needs. The program harnesses expertise and creativity across the Earth sciences by enabling collaborative science and evaluating grassroots community-led solutions to current challenges in geochronology and geosciences more broadly. The project activities propagate a web of new relationships that position the greater geoscience community to make transformative scientific advances on the dynamics and complexity of Earth processes and systems. This project funds over 150 strategic micro-awards across three subprograms to engage hundreds across the Earth sciences in collaborative science, training, review, and governance activities. Still broader engagement and integration will be achieved through annual, virtual, fully open AGeS community meetings, a website that will host project blogs and deliverables, and a formalized governance model that includes steering and review committees with rotating members designed to balance experience with new engagement. Assessment and evaluation activities will provide formative feedback to shape the initiative over its arc. Belonging, accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity are infused throughout all activities, and outcomes of diverse participation will be sought via inclusive and accessible practices that also promote a sense of connection and belonging in the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
