 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to create a method for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 often called \u201cforever\u201d chemicals - in water. PFAS contamination is a significant global problem, and it is estimated that 97% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. The resultant human and animal health implications include immunological, reproductive, developmental, hepatic, hormonal, and carcinogenic diseases. Currently, the removal of PFAS in drinking water resources is a major focus of the federal government and among many state governments. However, the cost, intensive maintenance, and complexity of available advanced water treatment technologies have often made their adoption out of reach. While these harmful PFAS are difficult to destroy, the proposed novel process transforms them into harmless byproducts. This project has the potential to treat PFAS-contaminated water with lower energy costs and faster removal rates, which could be broadly useful to affected communities throughout the country. The approach integrates advanced processes without extensive energy requirements and without the need for chemical use and post-processing. This technology is expected to be affordable, scalable, and easy to operate and maintain on-site.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and implement a novel cathodic treatment system for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from groundwater. The unique design proposes to employ both reductive and oxidative cathodes for PFAS removal. The project aims to research, design, and test an electrochemical cell prototype with novel electrode materials that support electrochemically-induced reduction and oxidation processes. Tasks include testing the electrode substrates and catalyst-coating materials and optimizing the operational parameters relative to rapid breaking of C-F bonds and low-energy consumption. The project will develop a robust electrochemical device that operates under environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS and other co-contaminants, such as natural organic matter and chlorinated volatile organics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
