Neuromorphic information processing seeks to develop artificial neural systems, whose design principles are based on biological nervous systems. Advantages of this paradigm including low-energy fault-tolerant computing and life-long learning make this technology logical candidate for the next generation of AI systems at the edge.\r\nThe present project is a half-day research workshop on large scale neuromorphic computing infrastructure. This workshop will bring together globally recognized leaders in neuromorphic computing and its application domains as well as nationally recognized HPC leaders to initiate discussions on the opportunities and challenges in developing large scale neuromorphic computing systems and merging them into heterogeneous cyberinfrastructure. The proposed workshop is intended to establish a continuous dialog between experts in academia, industry, application sectors, and national research labs, to shape the direction and accelerate neuromorphic research activities towards addressing the future cyberinfrastructure needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNeuromorphic systems that emulate or mimic neurobiological principles on hardware, often with higher-order performance on natural tasks, are seeing significant growth in recent times. However, access to such neuromorphic computing resources is inadvertently targeted towards experts in the field. This workshop is motivated by the current expanded interest in the field and new ideas about the access of neuromorphic computing resources to the broader scientific community to reap its benefits in multiple application domains. Non-native neuromorphic researchers should be able to use these computational resources with the same ease as native ones. The questions through the workshop were framed around, what such an infrastructure should look like and what are the opportunities or barriers to designing such research infrastructures. With over 100 participants from multiple disciplines, the workshop presentations and discussions demonstrated how neuromorphic computing is at an inflection-point and calls for development of large-scale neuromorphic systems with broader access. \n\nThe panel sessions fostered brainstorming on several open questions in scaling up neuromorphic computing. Moreover, the workshop also engaged the community in identifying common goals to work towards better accessibility and reach of neuromorphic computing. A few of the key findings from the workshop are summarized below. \n\nThere was a good degree of consensus on the key features for large-scale neuromorphic systems. These systems should be distributed and hierarchical, so that they can operate at varying spatial and temporal scales. Such systems should be able to communicate information both synchronously and asynchronously. They should have the ability to scale the number of neurons dynamically based on the application. These systems should be expandable and reconfigurable, so that they can be reconfigured dynamically to fit the application needs. \n\nSeveral application domains beyond AI were discussed. Example applications include compression of data in both lossy and lossless formats, rendering of 2D and 3D latent spaces for computer graphics, generative design of structures, shapes, layouts, etc. for architecture and mechanical engineering, cryptography for encryption, graph algorithms to perform massively parallel network-based computations, and constrained optimization.  \n\n Specific focus on what is currently missing in the neuromorphic computing field was discussed. This includes development of user-friendly frameworks at different abstraction levels for non-experts, development of cross-platform neuromorphic software libraries, continued dialogue on neuromorphic benchmarks and metrics for different applications and setting up a standardized guide for newcomers to the \"neuromorphic computing\" field. \n\nThese ideas and concepts drawn from the brainstorming sessions between experts in the field and practitioners were compiled into a white paper titled \"Establishing a Course for Effective Neuromorphic Computing Ecosystems at Scale\" submitted to the Nature journal (currently under review).  \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dhireesha Kudithipudi"
