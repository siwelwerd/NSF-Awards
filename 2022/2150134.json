 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hosted at Northwestern University, the Quantitative Biology REU (QBREU) program will provide intensive summer undergraduate research experiences at the interface of the mathematical and life sciences. Participants in this eight-week program will develop and apply cutting-edge mathematical and computational models to address questions ranging from basic molecular biology to biomedical applications. Recruitment efforts at primarily undergraduate institutions (including community colleges) and minority-serving institutions will be conducted with the aim of encouraging applications from students from underrepresented groups. A diversity peer-mentoring program will provide academic and professional support for participants. The program begins with an intensive computing practicum, after which students will work closely with faculty mentors on research projects in mathematical and computational biology. Weekly workshops will train students in scientific writing and presentations, interdisciplinary communication, and the graduate school and fellowship application process, and will provide information about career opportunities. QBREU students will be integrated with the Center for Quantitative Biology at Northwestern University [CQuB], providing an exciting intellectual environment and a broad view of quantitative biology research. The program culminates in a Research Symposium during which QBREU students will present their work. \r\n\r\nQBREU will contribute to the training of a diverse workforce with expertise in quantitative biology and interdisciplinary research. It will promote interest and prepare students to develop novel mathematical strategies for the study of living systems. Through its emphasis on inclusive recruitment and culturally aware mentor training, QBREU will contribute to diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Student research projects will encompass a variety of mathematical approaches (from differential equations to probabilistic models of phase transitions to topological data analysis) applied to biological processes ranging from gene regulation to morphogenesis. Students will be closely mentored by diverse faculty spanning multiple departments, and will receive additional mentorship from CQuB PhD students and postdocs as well as Northwestern University Diversity Fellows. A comprehensive evaluation plan, including validated surveys and structured interviews administered by evaluation experts, will provide actionable feedback and measures of success.\r\n\r\nhttps://sites.northwestern.edu/quantitativebiologyreu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
