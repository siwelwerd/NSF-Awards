 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student interest in CS among Pennsylvania students is strong; computer science and programming careers topped the charts in a student occupational interest survey. The state is also making strides in developing and supporting a vision to bring CS learning opportunities to all students in the state; with CS courses counting as math/science credit for graduation in PA public schools. However, challenges remain in realizing a vision for equitable and inclusive computer science education in PA high schools. There is still a large gap in access to CS courses, with particularly low enrollment for students from historically underrepresented groups in computing. This partnership between Drexel University and the School District of Philadelphia is a key step to broadening participation of PA students from historically excluded groups in computing. The project team leverages prior work and recent statewide policies to prepare a larger cohort of teachers for certification to teach computer science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Researcher Practitioner Partnership is to bring equitable, inclusive, and high-quality computer science instruction aligned with educational standards to all Philadelphia students through a Networked Improvement Community (NIC). The critical problem the partnership will address is the lack of equitable access to certified CS educators in Philadelphia high schools. This project partners the School District of Philadelphia (SDP), high school teachers and administrators, teacher associations, community and informal education organizations, high school students, parents, and researchers to address this by: offering multiple pathways to certification; identifying a diverse pool of potential CS educators; strengthening support and communities of practice for current and potential CS educators; and working with public sector stakeholders to develop a more effective policy framework that encourages a more diverse pool of CS educators. The investigators represent leadership in CS4Philly, an affiliate of the national CSforALL consortium, and the Philadelphia STEM Ecosystem CS Workgroup.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
