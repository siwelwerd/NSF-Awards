 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program of the James Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics Group (JMU--PNP) is focused on developing an accurate, 3D picture of the nucleon and on measuring fundamental quantities essential to our understanding of the subatomic world such as the charge radius of the proton and the anomalous muon magnetic moment. The latter holds the promise of probing physics beyond the Standard Model. Given the minuscule size of the nucleon, roughly a millionth of a billionth of a meter, these are not trivial tasks, as they require custom-built detectors, innovative techniques, and in-house developed software. The JMU-PNP group has a long record of excellence in these areas. Through immersion in this state-of-the-art research in intermediate energy nuclear physics, the PIs offer an outstanding educational experience for undergraduate students. Developing solutions for the hardware, software, and big data challenges associated with this research constitute great teaching tools in the formation of undergraduate students, promoting science and educating beyond the university. \r\n\r\nJMU-PNP group members have a robust presence at Jefferson Lab (experiments in Hall A, B, and C). For the duration of this award the group\u2019s activities aimed at completing the 3D picture of the nucleon include Machine Learning-based structure function and generalized parton distribution studies, and the study of open strangeness production and hadron formation mechanisms (experiment E12-06-117 in Hall B, with group members among the spokespeople). As part of the effort of solving the \u201cproton charge radius puzzle\u201d, the group has joined the PRad-II collaboration, and a group member plays a key role in the effort to secure funding for building this detector. To support future nuclear physics experiments JMU-PNP research will continue to have a strong hardware and software development component. This includes assemble and test the JMU-designed voltage dividers for the SBS ECAL calorimeter; procure and characterize the PMTs for the PRad-II calorimeter and perform long-overdue maintenance and modernization work on several software packages (simulation, charge symmetric background, radiative corrections) essential in the data analysis workflow. The group will also maintain a significant presence in the Fermilab g-2 experiment, which holds the promise of uncovering physics Beyond the Standard Model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
