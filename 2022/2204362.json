 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will hold the 17th Chemical Engineering Summer School from July 24-29, 2022, at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. At the behest of AIChE, the Summer School was initiated in 1931 by the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, now known as ASEE, to promulgate best practices in chemical engineering education. The Summer School has since been held every five years and continues to be a valuable professional development resource for hundreds of new chemical engineering faculty members. The 2022 Summer School attendees will engage in a half-day Teaching Institute, attend plenary talks, and participate in sessions on pedagogy, diversity and inclusivity, emerging technical topics in the field, and industry-related content. The Summer School agenda includes time for both informal and structured professional networking with other attendees and organizers as well as invited industrial representatives. At the conclusion of the Summer School, attendees will have developed new skills and knowledge to improve their teaching effectiveness and have discovered a peer network with whom they can share new insights and continue to grow as chemical engineering educators. The attendees' early investment in learning effective teaching strategies will manifest benefits with each subsequent cohort of chemical engineering graduates. \r\n\r\nThe 2022 Chemical Engineering Summer School emerges from the partnership between the AIChE Chemical Education Division and the ASEE Chemical Engineering Division to provide new faculty members with effective teaching strategies. The Summer School is a unique professional development opportunity for new chemical engineering faculty and builds upon a model that has been successful for decades. The Summer School curriculum is rooted in evidence-based teaching practices taught by experienced chemical engineering educators. Attendees are, thus, expected to come away from the Summer School having developed their teaching portfolios, strategies for adopting active and cooperative learning in courses, as well as an understanding of how to assess student performance and outcomes and to use this information to improve teaching effectiveness. The Summer School agenda also includes \"Industry Day\" programming to support effective undergraduate curricula design and to discuss the keys to successful industrial-academic research collaborations. Virtual communities of practice, supported via the AIChE Engage platform, will provide attendees with opportunities to continue sharing and learning best practices with their colleagues for years to come.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
