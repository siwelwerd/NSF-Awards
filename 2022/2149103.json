 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decarbonization is an important goal of climate policy and one that relies heavily on electrical infrastructure as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Different stakeholders emphasize different means of achieving a common goal, from smart technologies involving automated use of algorithms, to approaches involving more consistent monitoring by scientists and engineers. This project aims to evaluate the concerns and hopes of various stakeholders in electrification projects. It tests theories in cultural anthropology to understand how level of involvement (state versus lab versus community) and priorities (person- versus environment-centered) shape understandings of electrification goals and outcomes. It contributes to the training of a doctoral student in scientific cultural anthropology and its results will be disseminated widely to academic and non-academic audiences. \r\n\r\nThe researchers use participant observation and semi-structured interviews to answer the following research questions: 1) What challenges do electrical engineers perceive in building electrical infrastructure? How are these resolved? 2) What role do data scientists play in contributing to design and innovation of electrical infrastructure? What additional goals do they incorporate into this process? 3) How do other stakeholders, such as residents and policymakers, understand and seek to contribute to this process? Answers to these questions will provide insights that are relevant to shaping electrical infrastructure and will inform our understanding of how different perspectives converge and diverge in the context of shared goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nIn recent years, federal and local state institutions have implemented an array of policies and programs in service of transitioning US energy systems away from fossil fuels in ways that are just and community-centered. The passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022 have generated a historic influx of federal funding intended to foster a clean energy economy. Amongst this broader investment, the Department of Energys (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has received billions in additional funds. WAP programs fall within the scope of the Biden Administrations Justice40 initiative, in which all relevant programs must ensure that 40% of the overall benefits of federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.\n\n\nFor the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), the political goal of creating clean, just, and community-centered energy systems is largely dependent on interventions in peoples homes (mobile, single-family, and multi-family homes). This project, based on 13 months of in-depth ethnographic research with Colorados Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), follows energy professionals as they seek to implement decarbonization initiatives in the form of beneficial electrification measures (i.e. by installing air-source heat pumps, electric water heaters, and solar) in such homes across the state.
