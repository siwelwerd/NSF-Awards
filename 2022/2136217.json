 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Training Group project aims to enhance research in the field of dynamics. Dynamics is a vibrant area of mathematics, originating with the work of Poincar\u00e9 in celestial mechanics, that aims to describe the time evolution of mechanical systems and of abstract models of such systems. Ten faculty members at Northwestern University are leading undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in vertically integrated activities to enhance their education and professional development. The larger goal is to increase the number of researchers in the US who are well prepared to carry out work in the mathematical sciences, with a focus on increasing the numbers from historically underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe specialties of the participating faculty cover a wide range of dynamical fields and interact with numerous other areas of mathematics, including number theory, combinatorics, partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, group theory, probability, and representation theory. The project includes summer thematic schools, research workshops, and research experiences for undergraduates that will enhance training across the US, as well as revision and expansion of the curriculum and other activities that will benefit graduate students and undergraduates. The improved training is designed to lead to greater competitiveness for US citizens and permanent residents at every level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
