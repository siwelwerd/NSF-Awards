 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific research in most scientific fields today involves significant amounts of data as well as software to operate on that data. Furthermore, research increasingly requires data from across a number of sources, perhaps even fields. This is a significant challenge for the scientific community, and better solutions are needed in order to enable new discoveries and accelerate the societal impacts from those discoveries. The approach in this project is to follow in the footsteps of the web and it aims to standardize how scientific data is described, allowing for tools addressing the above challenges, such as search engines for scientific data that not only support discoverability but also facilitate the usage of the data.\r\n\r\nThe DeCODER project will expand and extend the successful EarthCube GeoCODES platform and community to unify data and tool description and re-use across geoscience domains. Building on the NSF CIF21 vision, the EarthCube program was formed to address the technological challenges surrounding data and software within the geosciences. Through extensive interaction with the community this culminated in two key activities around data discovery and reuse. First, the promotion, refinement, and adoption of schema.org to annotate geosciences metadata within distributed repositories so that datasets can be crawled. Second, the promotion and support for the adoption of notebooks to document, share, and reuse software as peer reviewed scholarly objects. A rallying point around these activities was the GeoCODES platform, which allows communities to stand up instances of scientific search engines specific to their domains, while building a community of geoscience data users and developers and, ultimately, reducing the time to science. This project will leverage this effort in the DeCODER platform to enable similar activities and outcomes across scientific communities. This work will continue the endeavor to support the scientific community in the adoption of schema.org and notebooks, facilitating this by providing DeCODER as an open source resource that can be customized by a given scientific community to create lightweight scientific gateways that bring together relevant distributed resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
