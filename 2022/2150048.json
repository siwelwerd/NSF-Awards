 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 1: Planning and Pilot Program grant aims to increase student retention/persistence and preparedness in Computer, Electrical, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science (CS) majors, thereby increasing their degree attainment at the University of Bridgeport. Additionally, along with faculty development, the grant aims to enhance undergraduate CS and engineering teaching strategies that will lead to students\u2019 higher degree completion rates. Barriers, like financial hardships and lack of research mentorship, for low-income, first-generation, and minority students prevent them from completing baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines. Further, cultural and academic barriers can lower self-efficacy and self-identity as a scientist and engineer when they participate in research experiences. Project ACHIEVE will implement the Affinity Research Group Model from the Computing Alliance for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) through an engaging undergraduate research course, Introduction to Scientific Research Challenges. This course will offer an opportunity to participate in research experiences with faculty and graduate students in Computer Science, Computer, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering programs.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this Track 1 PPP project is to implement, evaluate, and produce preliminary knowledge on evidence-based methods to overcome significant barriers to entry and persistence among students in undergraduate engineering and computer science degree programs. The project will adapt the Affinity Research Group Model, a set of practices built on a cooperative team framework to support the creation and maintenance of dynamic and inclusive research groups. It will pilot an intervention to mitigate known barriers to maintaining engagement in and completing STEM majors, focusing on students\u2019 acquisition of career-related skills, connectedness to professionals, and building their confidence to complete an intellectually demanding course of study. It will address the research questions as follows. (1) How does the Affinity Research Group Model play a role in increasing students\u2019 persistence in engineering and computer science majors during their first two years of study? (2) How does the model play a role in increasing students\u2019 engineering self-efficacy during their first two years of study? (3) What are the approaches used by the faculty when implementing the model that leads to the development of students\u2019 research skills (laboratory research skills followed by publication) \u2013 a community of practice, engagement with students outside the classroom, etc.? This project will inform the next phase of implementation, which will generate data useful for replication, adaptation, and increased knowledge about increasing student representation in engineering and computer science majors and associated STEM careers. It will also develop a community of practice for faculty to apply the model for other underrepresented undergraduates in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
