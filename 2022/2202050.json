 "awd_abstract_narration": "The internal combustion engine has dominated the transportation industry and has led to decreased environmental quality and increased health issues from engine emissions. Today, an estimated one billion light duty vehicles are on the roads, consuming one fourth of global primary oil and contributing 10% to the global greenhouse gas emissions The adoption of electric vehicles (EV) can reduce dependency on oil and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, industry leaders agree that there is an immediate shortage of skilled technical workers across almost every sector required to support the EV industry. Workforce projections estimate that the all-EV industry will add 250,000 to 500,000 new high paying jobs by 2030. This project will establish a National Electric Vehicle Consortium (NEVC) to support the collaboration of academic, agency, and industry experts across all EV disciplines to help secure the nation\u2019s EV workforce with partners from 15 community colleges, 19 industry partners, two research universities, and ATE Centers and projects.\r\n\r\nThe consortium will focus on the following fields within the EV sector: manufacturing; installation; operations, maintenance, and repair; vehicle conversion; safety and standards; and emerging technological advances in the sector. Goals for the consortia include: 1) provide a venue for national collaboration to network training needs with training providers to support broad scale outreach, community-building among educational institutions, industry, professional, trade, and regulatory associations, educators, and practicing technicians within the EV Ecosystem; 2) document workforce needs and skills and competencies, for all areas of the emerging EV sector; 3) collect data on academic programs and curricular resources across the EV sector; 4) align academic programs and courses with the EV industry sector needs and address programmatic gaps; 5) support institutions of higher education in adapting legacy programs or establishing new EV programs. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
