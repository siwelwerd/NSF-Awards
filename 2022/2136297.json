 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help treat the common nosebleed. Nosebleeds are a common problem that 60% of people experience. The proposed project develops an effective and low-cost innovative technology to address this by combining external pressure with intranasal medication when placed in a nominal manner by any user. The solution would provide a simple method that reduces the need for patients to visit health care services, and reduces the burden of health care providers for treating nosebleeds. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to design and develop an effective nosebleed treatment device for children and adults that combines external pressure using a prototype nasal clip with intranasal medication sponges. The objectives of this project include completing systematic studies towards (1) design and development of a nasal clip with pre-medicated intranasal sponges capable of consistently applying the proper amount of pressure and eluting the proper amount of medication when placed in a nominal manner, (2) testing of the device using a nosebleed model, (3) identifying manufacturing processes to commercialize and scale the device in a cost effective manner. The outcome will be a functional and lab tested nosebleed treatment clip.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
