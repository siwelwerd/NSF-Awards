 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovaiton Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable method to grow healthy produce for individuals residential consumers, independent of location, climate, or season of the year. Rotary aeroponic growing systems have the potential to reduce food waste, potable water consumption, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions by decentralizing the production of highly perishable produce within a consumer's home. Growing fresh produce in the home may not require the use of pesticides or preservatives. Socio-disadvantaged individuals located in food deserts may benefit from an automated indoor gardening appliance by subscribing to low-cost organic seed pods that could be delivered and grown directly in their home, generate long-term returns on investment and lowering instances of obesity through healthier diets. Studying the effects of light interactions in a small rotary aeroponic appliance my encourage a new market for high margin seed pods that could be assembled in mass quantities by disabled individuals. Converting highly perishable goods into non-perishable, subscription seed pods may have the potential to reduce food prices and reduce instances of food insecurity throughout the world.\r\n\r\nRotary aeroponic cultivation is the method of growing plants on a rotating cylindrical tower that is affixed vertically within a controlled environmental chamber. The key innovation in this project is the coupling of rotary aeroponics with tunable lighting to enhance the growing efficiency of the plants. Phase II research will examine how the wavelengths and timing of the lighting can impact plant photomorphogenesis.  The tower design is expected to provide a larger surface area for growing plants in comparison to traditional vertical farming methods, increasing the number of plants that can be grown in a smaller space with less power consumption. The goal of this project is to successfully grow a healthy polyculture assortment of leafy green vegetables in a food safe environment. The multi-spectral light will be used to learn how to maximize plant yields, minimize food safety risks, and enhance the taste profiles of different plant types to ensure the best user experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
