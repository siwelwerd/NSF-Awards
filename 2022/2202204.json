 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of Geographic Information Science Technology (GIST) is expanding in many fields and occupations in the Pacific Northwest and across the country as more sophisticated commercial uses are developed and implemented. This interdisciplinary field, which encompasses geography, computer science, and mathematics in spatial problem solving, is used in governmental agencies and private companies to solve many U.S. and global societal challenges. As employees within these companies retire or as these industries expand, employees with the most current knowledge of technologies and practices are needed. This project will support the growing need for well-educated surveying/mapping technicians in the region. Since STEM fields have not historically attracted many women, students of color, and low-income students, this project will focus on evidence-based interventions that support student recruitment, retention, and program completion for people from groups underrepresented in STEM. To recruit more diverse students the project will partner with culturally relevant community-based organizations (CBOs) and women STEM educators to identify high school and community college students interested in geospatial technology. Project-based learning using geospatial technology and paid internships will engage students in work-based skill development. This project will provide innovative opportunities for students, who never considered working in this STEM field, to enter an exciting new career. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve student recruitment, retention, and program completion in the Geospatial program, and position the program for future growth with regional GIST partners. The strategies that provide the foundation for this work include: 1) expanding partnerships with community-based organizations, 2) increasing recruitment efforts of specific student populations on campus and in the community, 3) conducting summer institutes for high school teachers and community college faculty in geospatial technologies, 4) creating a \"Women in Geospatial Careers\" workshop series, 5) redesigning a capstone course to incorporate more advanced technical skills, 6) expanding partnerships with regional industries, 7) collaborating with a regional geospatial association to provide mentors for the GIST students, and 8) equipping classrooms and labs with appropriate equipment and software to address the competencies needed for this emerging technical workforce. Results of the project will be made available to other community colleges and GIST partners to demonstrate the value of the recruitment and retention strategies and how they can be incorporated into existing pedagogical approaches. This project has potential to advance knowledge in the evolving GIST fields by implementing recruitment and retention strategies that have the greatest impact on individuals from groups underrepresented in geospatial programs. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
