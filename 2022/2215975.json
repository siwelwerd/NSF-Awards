 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Rutgers University \u2013 Newark is acquiring a high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) equipped with electrospray Ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) to support the research of Professor Frieder Jaekle and colleagues Elena Galoppini, Haesun Kim, Michal Szostak, and Colin Kinz-Thompson. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of organic chemistry, catalysis, semiconductors, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and biological sciences. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components are heated and flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized. The ions' masses are measured very accurately. The capabilities of the mass spectrometer instrument are augmented by complementary ESI and ambient pressure APCI and DART sources and will serve a wide host of research needs. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. The instrument gives students experience using vital instrumentation that they carry with them into their careers. The research groups using the instrument are also actively participate in multiple successful programs to aid recruiting from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe award of this mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The new instrument will serve as an important characterization tool for research that spans areas ranging from synthetic chemistry, catalysis, materials science to biophysical and biological sciences. research will be enabled in amide bond activation, cross-coupling and catalysis, organocatalysis and green synthesis, molecular electrocatalysts for energy conversion,  chromophore-semiconductor interfaces, organoboranes in materials science and catalysis, bacterial chemosensing,  choline transport in myelin-forming glial cells, lipid metabolism in brain health and disease,  lysozyme-mediated bacterial cell-wall-processing, and biological sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
