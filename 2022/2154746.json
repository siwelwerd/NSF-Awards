 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like many semiarid ecosystems around the world, southern California is subject to increasingly frequent and intense wildfires and droughts. These extreme events can cause long-term changes in the ecosystem by allowing invasive weeds to replace native shrubs and disrupting the physical structure of soil and the communities of microscopic organisms (microbes) like bacteria and fungi that live in the soil. These changes to plants, microbes and soils can affect how the whole ecosystem works, including how effectively the ecosystem can absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and store carbon for a long time as organic matter. The ability of land to absorb and store carbon is very important because it can slow down the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere, slowing down its effects on the climate. Computer models predict how future changes in ecosystems will influence atmospheric CO2. However, there is not enough information to make confident predictions of how wildfire and drought will change semiarid ecosystems like southern California shrublands. Studying the combined effects of wildfire and drought requires experiments where otherwise similar parts of the landscape are either burned or unburned, and the amount of rain falling on an experimental plot can be controlled. For safety reasons, prescribed burns are carried out under conditions that are very different from natural wildfires, and might represent how real wildfires will affect ecosystems. On the other hand, wildfires are unpredictable. This makes it hard to plan an experiment that requires comparable burned and unburned landscape, access to the location, preliminary information about the area before the fire, and the time to establish rain shelters before the onset of seasonal rains. This NSF RAPID project takes advantage of such an opportunity, in which a wildfire burned part of a well-studied nature preserve, and a rainfall experiment could be established before the main rainy season, given immediate action.\r\n\r\nThis project takes advantage of a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to combine a natural wildfire with a controlled rainfall experiment in a factorial design and incorporate the data into an improved model for predicting the response of semiarid ecosystems to episodic and gradual aspects of climate change. This RAPID award allows rainfall shelters to be constructed in burned and unburned areas prior to the onset of seasonal rains. The project tests the hypotheses that fire and drought will interact to promote invasion by grasses and other herbaceous species, and cause 1) earlier phenology of ecosystem C gain as well as a shorter growing season, and 2) an increase in the vulnerability of the ecosystem to loss of C and N via changes in soil structure and microbial communities. Thus, together fire and drought will synergistically contribute to lower ecosystem C stocks. This project will (1) establish a factorial drought \u00d7 wild fire experiment, (2) measure ecosystem responses (including plant and soil components) to the factorial treatments, and (3) organize these data for incorporation into the Millennial Model and the Community Earth System Model (CESM), enabling predictions for both the U.S. Southwest, and other semiarid ecosystems around the world. C and N will be measured in soil physical fractions (various size classes of aggregates, particulate organic matter, microbial biomass, etc.), and the microbial community structure will be characterized using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Plant measurements will include community composition, phenology, and ecophysiological measurements at the canopy and leaf level, and remotely sensed imagery at the landscape level. The ecosystem modeling activities will place these data into an ecosystem-level framework. This one-year project will lay the groundwork for longer-term studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The combined effects of these disturbances on ecosystems is uncertain, and greater understanding is needed to manage the effects of fire, plant invasion and extreme climatic events. This project established rain shelters (3m x 3m) that blocked 66% of incoming rainfall, paired with control plots that received 100% of rainfall, in areas of a landscape that had recently experienced a wildfire and in adjacent areas outside the fire perimeter. The team consisted of a soil scientist, a plant ecologist and an ecosystem modeler, along with their students. For all three years of the study, soils from the burned areas had reduced organic matter content and a deteriorated structure compared to unburned soils. Soil structure refers to how individual soil particles are stuck together into &ldquo;aggregates,&rdquo; which improve the ability of the soil to store carbon and nutrients, resist erosion, and support plant growth. In one year of the study (2023), the region received more than twice the normal amount of rainfall. In this extreme rainfall year, the rain shelters prevented loss of soluble carbon and nitrogen from the soils. The soil microbial community was greatly affected by wildfire. Soil microbes (mainly bacteria and fungi) are essential for the health of soils, recycling nutrients from decaying organic matter, retaining carbon and nutrients in soils, and promoting the growth of plants. Microbial biomass and biodiversity was reduced in burned areas, and the bacterial species present shifted to represent a more stressful state. Stress-resistant bacteria became more abundant while sensitive, slow-growing bacteria and those that grow best under moderate conditions declined.</p>\r\n<p>These changes to the soil persisted despite the rapid recovery of plant growth, which was nearly the same as in unburned areas by three years after the fire. Plant growth after the wildfire, as measured by the absorbance of wavelengths of light used for photosynthesis, depended on the amount of rainfall but also on the location on the landscape. The area that burned with higher intensity wildfire (based on the largest diameter of surviving woody stems after the fire) had lower soil N and grew less vigorously than the lower intensity burn area. However, the lower burn intensity area regrew with a higher cover of the invasive mustard, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>, and these invasive plants may have been responsible for the low recovery of native shrubs in this area. &nbsp;The results of this study were used in an ecosystem model to help predict the effects of wildfires and plant invasion over the next century. The model projects substantial carbon losses from the ecosystem due to projected fires and plant invasion across all future climate scenarios, but the main causes of these ecosystem carbon losses change in the future, suggesting that control of invasive plants will become increasingly important in managing the impacts of future wildfires in these ecosystems. In addition to the scientific results this study produced, the project provided training opportunities for at least eight undergraduate researchers, five Masters students, three doctoral students, and two postdoctoral researchers, and contributed to the curriculum of two university courses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/25/2025<br>\nModified by: David&nbsp;Lipson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2154746/2154746_10774959_1742920576118_BeforeAfterFireMap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2154746/2154746_10774959_1742920576118_BeforeAfterFireMap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Before-After Fire Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2154746/2154746_10774959_1742920576118_BeforeAfterFireMap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Before-After Fire Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map showing experimental plots and images of landscape before and after the January 2021 wildfire</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Google Earth, David Lipson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Lipson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Before-After Fire Map</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2154746/2154746_10774959_1742920866143_20221014_143853--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2154746/2154746_10774959_1742920866143_20221014_143853--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rain shelters in recently burned landscape\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2154746/2154746_10774959_1742920866143_20221014_143853--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rain shelters in recently burned landscape\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rain shelters (3 x 3m) constructed in a landscape that had recently burned in a wildfire</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Lipson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Lipson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rain shelters in recently burned landscape</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
