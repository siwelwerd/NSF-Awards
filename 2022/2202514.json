 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis award supports experimental research and education to advance basic knowledge in spintronics and magnetism. Spintronics uses electron spin to construct highly performing electronic devices beyond the conventional semiconductor chips. The magnetic entities or particles that the research team investigates are called magnetic skyrmions, tiny magnetic swirls that arise in two-dimensional materials that can be used for computing and information storage.  Through the research efforts, the team can effectively control the motion of skyrmions and construct skyrmionic devices, thereby providing a research platform to train the next generation of scientists in spintronics. The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop new fabrication processes and characterization techniques that could lead to revolutionary computing, security, and sensing devices. The PI uses the most sophisticated high resolution magnetic imaging and electronic measurement techniques to uncover new spin-based physical phenomena. The PI plans to train diverse groups of students in materials/devices processing and characterization. The research team strives to make a lasting contribution to the science education of the public and young people. Research on nanoscale physics and devices has positive impacts on our society in areas of computing, information storage and processing, quantum sensing, and medical diagnostics. Skyrmion-enabled devices consume low power or less expensive materials, which mitigates climate change. With great potential in discovery and invention, this research project furthers the United States\u2019 competitive edge in the electronics industry and help maintain leadership in advanced research, manufacturing, and innovation. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to understand the static and dynamic properties of magnetic skyrmions in magnetic multilayers, by exploring the interactions between skyrmions and various excitations including the magnetic field and spin current. The PI aims to achieve an understanding of the static, global and local dynamic behavior of skyrmions, both individually and collectively as clusters. The experimental approach utilizes state-of-the-art sample fabrication, submicron lithography, advanced imaging techniques and highly sensitive electronic measurements. The research team relies on micromagnetic simulations, electron magnetotransport theory, and condensed matter physics on spin-orbit coupling. The team plans to develop new device paradigms with advantages over existing designs in non-volatility of information, probabilistic computing, low power consumption, nanoscale scalability, ultrafast operation, and thermal stability. The project advances basic knowledge in spintronics and physics of topological magnetism. The team plans to develop understanding about single-skyrmion behavior, skyrmion-skyrmion interactions and their interactions with external controls and local variations in the spatial energy landscape. Through the research efforts, the team can effectively control skyrmions and construct skyrmionic devices, providing a research platform to train the next generation of scientists in the critical technological area of spintronics. The PI plans to train and educate diverse groups of students in their acquisition of condensed matter physics knowledge and experimental skills in materials/devices processing and characterization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
