 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award provides support for early career U.S. based mathematicians to attend a summer school and two workshops to be held in the period from September to December 2022 at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics (HIM), Bonn, Germany. The summer school is called \u201cSpectral Methods in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology\u201d (September 19-23, 2022), and the two workshops are \u201cSpectral Methods in Equivariant Mathematics\u201d (October 24-28, 2022) and \u201cSpectra, Triangles, and Higher Structures\u201d (December 5-9, 2022). These events are associated with the trimester program \"Spectral Methods in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology\", founded on the observation that various areas of the mathematical fields of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and algebra that have been historically regarded as separate and distinct are now in fact united by overlapping problems, common goals, related foundational questions, and similar techniques. The grant would provide training and career development for students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty. \r\n \r\nThe program will cover a diverse mixture of topics from algebra, geometry, and algebraic topology, centered around the theme of studying and applying spectral techniques and tensor-triangular structure. This includes traditional topics, such as classification problems in algebra or computations in chromatic homotopy theory, but also emerging topics in motivic homotopy theory and the interplay between infinity categories and representation theory. Further information about workshops and the program in general can be found at https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/future-programs/future-trimester-programs/spectral-methods/description/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
