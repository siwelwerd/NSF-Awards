 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) will engage high school (HS) and community college (CC) educators in cutting edge hands-on research experiences in Advanced Manufacturing/Robotics. This training program will enhance educators\u2019 knowledge and skills in the stated domain. The educators will return to their institutions, develop advanced manufacturing curriculum modules, and enhance the interest of their students. The U.S. Midwest is known as the heartland of U.S. manufacturing. Today\u2019s manufacturing is quite different from traditional manufacturing and it relies heavily on automated and integrated systems. Traditional manufacturing skills are no match to those advanced manufacturing/robotics skills. This RET project provides a platform for researchers and educators to investigate new research opportunities to fill the existing skills gap in advanced manufacturing. The participating educators will translate their research experiences and knowledge into classroom practice. This comprehensive and unique experience will play a transformational role in preparing future leaders in the emerging areas of advanced manufacturing/robotics within the U.S. Midwest region.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) is to play a transformational role in preparing future leaders in advanced manufacturing by instilling advanced manufacturing/robotics research experience within STEM educators through six-week summer workshops dedicated to hands-on research experiences. The summer workshops will focus on research activities in emerging areas of advanced manufacturing including modern sensors and actuators, advanced robot programming, CNC programming, CAD/CAM, 3D printing, and e-factory. This RET project will strategically engage 18 HS and 18 CC educators from regional HSs and CCs in research experiences. This project will impact more than 6,400 STEM students at local high schools and community colleges and cements the partnership among BGSU, local high schools, and community colleges to address the common need of producing STEM graduates in advanced manufacturing area. This project will (a) explore a sustainable educational model that connects high schools, community colleges, university, and industry; (b) improve the existing pathways and implement new pathways, expanding opportunities for STEM students; and c) play a transformational role in preparing future leaders in advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
