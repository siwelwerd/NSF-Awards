 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the first South Central Topology Conference (SCTC) taking place September 25-26, 2021 at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. The primary goals of this regional conference include: developing a community of collaborators and experts of varied interests in topology in the region, showcasing a sample of current research directions in topology in the South Central region and beyond it, and communicating developing and exciting results in ways accessible to topologists of all ilks. This conference is timely in light of the research growth in topology in the South Central Region in recent years. \r\n\r\n\r\nModern topology is a large and active field. The conference will be broad in its focus, and will provide a sample of recent research developments in fields such as chromatic and equivariant homotopy theory, higher algebra, symplectic and contact topology, mirror symmetry, and the topology of embedding spaces. The six plenary speakers, Anna Marie Bohmann (Vanderbilt University), Kristen Hendricks (Rutgers University), Robin Koytcheff (University of Louisiana at Lafayette), Jo Nelson (Rice University), Paul VanKoughnett (Texas A&M University), and Abigail Ward (MIT), will give one-hour colloquium-style presentations. There will also be eight short talks given by graduate students and postdocs on a wide range of topics. More information can be found on the conference web page: https://www.hiroleetanaka.com/sctc/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
