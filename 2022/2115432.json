 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paragraph 1\r\nNevada is the driest state in the nation and is facing multiple water sustainability challenges including declining mountain snowpacks, extreme weather, rapid population growth, and increasing urban-rural tensions. \u201cNevada Water\u201d will develop a partnership of water suppliers, users, policy-makers, and academics whose primary goal is to create a dynamic research, societal, and education network focusing on critical urban-rural water issues across Nevada. The network will include key public, private, tribal, research, nonprofit, and educational water resource partners. These planning activities will operate under the \u201cScience With Society\u201d concept, that emphasizes communication, connections, and collaboration. In this one-year project, Nevada Water partners will work together to a) identify crucial urban-rural water sustainability issues; b) discuss and frame different ways of thinking about water sustainability solutions; c) identify information, knowledge, and resource gaps need to be filled; d) develop shared visions for desirable, equitable, and sustainable water futures; and e) determine the best network structure to address Nevada\u2019s urban-rural water sustainability challenges. To achieve these goals, regional and thematically-based groups of partners will prepare the nascent network for a 2-day conference focused on characterizing information gaps, co-identifying water priorities, and network development. Nevada Water will foster new knowledge and collaboration strategies to significantly advance integration, coordination, innovation, and sustainable regional systems science.\r\n \r\n\r\nAcross Nevada, water users, suppliers, and policymakers are facing growing stressors including declining snowpacks, extreme weather, rapid population growth, and increasing urban-rural tensions around water sustainability. The Nevada Water network is a collaborative and inclusive partnership of water-related practitioners and academics whose primary goal is to create a dynamic research, societal, and education network focusing on critical urban-to-rural water issues across Nevada. The network will include key public, private, tribal, research, nonprofit, and educational water resource partners. Through a transformative Science-with-Society convergent approach, this Track 2 effort will a) co-identify key state and regional urban-rural water challenges in a changing climate; b) initiate stakeholder conversations to frame partner-based, equitable urban-rural water solutions; c) co-identify information needs, resource gaps, theoretical frameworks, applications, and research priorities towards advancing sustainable regional systems science to achieve regional water sustainability; d) foster new knowledge and deeper understanding of regional wicked water sustainability challenges, and envision desirable and equitable water futures; and e) determine the best structure and function of the network to serve these challenges, solutions, information needs, resource gaps, and future priorities. Urban-rural \u201ccollaboratories\u201d and thematic groups will prepare a network for a 2-day conference focused on characterizing information gaps, co-identifying water priorities, and network development. This Nevada Water network will foster new knowledge and collaboration strategies to significantly advance sustainable regional systems science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These urban-rural contrasts lead to diverging views on land and water use so, in many ways, Nevada&rsquo;s water issues are a harbinger for other regions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong></p>\r\n<p>The Nevada Water project was active from April 2021 &ndash; December 2024. The goal of the project was to lead the way for water resources planning in a time of growth and renewable energy development. We aimed to fill key knowledge gaps in water quantity, quality, and interactions at scales that are &ldquo;fit-for-purpose&rdquo;. Unlike traditional hydrologic science in which researchers develop testable hypotheses and proceed towards a conclusion, the Science With Society approach is a grassroots approach that is integrative and inclusive across multiple &lsquo;ways of knowing&rsquo; about hydrology and water resources, including traditional ecological knowledge, local knowledge, and multi-disciplinary Western science.</p>\r\n<p>In a fully collaborative Science With Society process, the up-front effort of understanding water challenges is significantly greater than in &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; hydrology and water resources but the outcomes have the potential to identify key challenges that are ripe for action.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong></p>\r\n<p>The Nevada Water network included over 120 from over 65 organizations including participants from Tribes; state agencies; federal agencies; municipal &amp; industrial stakeholders; environmental &amp; non-governmental organizations; and educators/researchers. The Nevada Water leadership team engaged in multiple facilitated discussions with stakeholder groups and visited them in their home areas. &nbsp;Our in-depth discussions revealed the following common themes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Collaboration is the driving force for success. Identifying shared and common goals and concerns is more important than identifying areas of conflict.</li>\r\n<li>Long-term drought is the overarching issue and is having multiple impacts on water quantity, water quality, and concerns about water rights.</li>\r\n<li>Over-appropriation and over-use of water, especially in groundwater-dominated basins is a critical concern. Many groundwater-dominated watersheds are exceeding perennial yield and groundwater levels are dropping which affects well users and reduces baseflow in streams.</li>\r\n<li>Conjunctive management of groundwater and surface water is difficult because surface water-groundwater interactions are not well understood and difficult to address with current water policies.</li>\r\n<li>Agencies that regulate and track water-related activities are chronically understaffed and challenged to address complex water issues in a timely manner.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Such theme agreement among the diverse water users, purveyors, regulators, and policy-makers was unexpected and welcomed. It was especially encouraging that collaboration was included as the top key theme. Subsequent all-hands discussions identified network priorities, a mission and vision, and the desire to continue the network-building effort that would collaboratively identify workable pathways to greater water sustainability across Nevada. In addition to a deeper collaborative understanding within our Nevada Water network, we co-developed a mission and vision, co-created and implemented educational modules, and co-produced an inclusive plan for the network structure, activities, and priorities within the context of Science With Society.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mission:</strong></p>\r\n<p>We bring together diverse organizations, agencies, tribes, and societal groups to collaboratively identify and address complicated urban-rural water challenges.
