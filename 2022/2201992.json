 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a material that may be activated by the wound and continuously produce a natural antimicrobial, hydrogen peroxide, until the clotting of the wound. Compared with existing products, this technology has an enhanced sterilization strength, does not use traditional antibiotics (no resistance concern), and could broadly kill pathogens. An example group of users is medical professionals or personnel that seek sterilization and protection to treat mild to moderate abrasions, cuts, and burns. Potential customers include physicians treating burns, skin surgeons, primary care doctors, and general populations. Besides wound applications, the technology may be adapted for other medical products for sterilization, e.g., incorporation into the membranes of face masks.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a material that may inhibit bacterial growth on the surface of the skin using the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). This technology may confirm the viability of GOx alone or in conjunction with other materials such as silver nanoparticles (AgNP) as an alternative to antibiotics in preventing bacterial growth on wounds. This proposed approach of preventing wound infections using GOx shows continued efficacy in acidic environments, and greatly improves growth reduction in gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. Preliminary data shows a significant reduction in bacterial colony forming units (CFU) using GOx that has been fixed to a paper membrane. It is expected that the GOx paper membrane or GOx alone could be easily added to bandages or other materials to form antimicrobial wound care products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
