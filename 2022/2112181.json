 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop an effective, engaging education platform to teach cybersecurity awareness and best practices to protect against cyber threats. Identity theft  affects millions of individuals every year, costing billions of dollars and severe personal difficulties to those affected. Privacy education is essential to address the potential dangers facing the billions of people using these platforms.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project plans to develop an online simulation product that engages citizens to experience cybersecurity simulations that emulate various real-world cyberthreats while implementing evidence-based learning research in digital media and instructional systems technologies. For educational service providers, this solution will provide an effective standards-based computer science and digital fluency learning approach to cybersecurity for the school-age population. By using developmentally appropriate instructional and teaching strategies, the solution plans to address and measure effectiveness across a wide range of age groups, demographics and education levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our goal is that a person with only limited knowledge of cybersecurity should still be able to grasp how their behavior on the internet impacts the risk they face of cyberattack. CyberSpara provides a simulation-based platform for privacy education where consumers can gain experience in dealing with cyberthreats, such as identity theft, in a safe, controlled environment so that they can be prepared to properly protect their identity when it matters. This simulation approach uses gamification to make the learning experience fun and engaging to people across a wide age range and at various levels of digital fluency. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addressed the need for an effective, engaging education platform to teach cyber security awareness and best practices to protect against cyber threats. One of the most prevalent of these threats is identity theft, which affects millions of individuals every year, costing billions of dollars and causing severe emotional distress to those affected. Given the proliferation of social media in the modern age, privacy education is essential to address the po tential dangers facing the billions of people using these platforms. While social media users span a wide range of age groups and education levels, across all these demographics, there has been a lack of effective education methods and standards for increasing user awareness. As social media and online activity become ever more pervasive, so too have the incidence and impact of cyber-attacks on individuals and industries. CyberSpara INC proposes DigitalPASS, a simple, cost-effective tool to teach cybersecurity and digital fluency practices regardless of user age and background. This product provides value to all individuals with a social media presence, where account hacking or identity theft could have financial and/or social ramifications. Marketing this product within the primary education system would provide the greatest value to society, as this age group is just starting to interact in the social media environment and is thus most vulnerable and in need of privacy education. Taught the principles of privacy awareness at an early age, they are then set up with a solid foundation to successfully navigate current and future cybersecurity challenges. This novel tool for cyber security education could provide value to a wide range of institutions within academia, industry, and government, benefiting society. CyberSpara rolls out DigitalPASS primarily through educational institutions and programs, such as schools and camps. As such, they seek licensing agreements with school districts and/or individual schools, as well as educational service providers. Over the course of the Phase I project, we were testing it with potential end-users, and further refined the scenarios. Because they were working through an institution to access appropriate test participants, they dually used this early-stage development as an opportunity to build traction and name recognition. The early results from running DigitalPASS have shown a 30% increase in the cyber-awareness of the individuals with only one 5-minute round of interacting with the platform. This result was consistent across the education spectrum of K-12. The important observation was that raising cyber-awareness was independent from the geographic privilege and economic development level of the participants.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Jake&nbsp; &nbsp;Rabideau</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2112181/2112181_10803263_1706799508048_digitalpass_logo--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2112181/2112181_10803263_1706799508048_digitalpass_logo--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"DigitalPASS Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2112181/2112181_10803263_1706799508048_digitalpass_logo--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"DigitalPASS Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">http://digitalpass.me</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">http://digitalpass.me</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jake&nbsp; &nbsp;Rabideau\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DigitalPASS Logo</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
