 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I aims to develop a novel method for monitoring dental implant stability. The system aims to provide a low cost temporary method for dentists to quantitatively assess the 27 million dental implants globally placed per year.  These implants currently have a 10-15% failure rate. The proposed system provides mechanical feedback on the bond stability between the implant and the surrounding bone that serves as a foundation for the crown and receives bite loads.  This bond stability provides direct, actionable information that may be superior to current subjective evaluations used by dentists including feel with their hands, X-Ray, or torqueing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to complete a proof of concept demonstration of a reliable and accurate device to measure the stability of dental implants using vibrational technology. The proposed system seeks to provide controlled forces to the implant in order to sense the degree of motion and stability.  This new technology has two critical concepts: the first is to quantify implant stability via angular stiffness at the gum line of the implant bone (i.e., the ability against rotation), and the second is the development of a clip-on sensor unit and a mechanics-based model to calculate implant stability.  This project seeks to develop a prototype with a design validated on in vitro mandible models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

QUIVER is an electro-mechanical device with a sensor, an actuator, a controller, and a mobile app. The device wiggles a dental implant via its abutment or crown with a gentle force and senses its motion. Its like a dentist wiggling a tooth to sense its looseness. The QUIVER device is further empowered by a rigorous mechanics-based model to realize precision dental medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis STTR Phase I project addresses not only dentists' needs for measuring implant stability but also patients' needs for reduced anxiety and fears. Stability refers to immobility of an implant in bone; it is a vital sign to indicate the well-being of a dental implant. Loss of stability is a leading indicator of bone loss, complications, and failing implants. There is no standard of care in measuring the stability. Our transformative concept is to use a mechanics-based model to extract angular stiffness of the implant-bone system to indicate its stability accurately and objectively. Angular stiffness is what a dentist senses while wiggling a tooth. As an analogy, angular stiffness is how strong the roots of a tree hold the ground as wind blows, or how difficult it is to flip the tab of a soda can.\n\n\nThe findings and results of the STTR Phase I project not only prove the concept of using angular stiffness to indicate implant stability, but also demonstrate the feasibility of using the QUIVER device to do so. Evidence to support these findings and results includes: (a) a working prototype of the QUIVER device, (b) a mechanics-based model and a conversion algorithm to extract angular stiffness thereof, and (c) a series of calibrated benchtop tests on mandibles and premolar sections made of artificial bones to validate the QUIVER device. A major outcome of the project is readiness to develop a real QUIVER product for the marketplace with a reduced commercialization risk.\n\n\nCommercialization of QUIVER will transform implant dentistry from an empirical-based practice to precision dental medicine that relies on quantitative measurements and data analysis. QUIVER, with its cumulative measurements data, can lead to a reliable risk-prediction model to make dental implant insurance affordable. This will generate broad societal impact, as our society is aging and the needs for dental implants are growing. The implant diagnostics market is traditionally controlled by foreign companies. QUIVER is made and invented entirely in USA. Success of QUIVER will significantly change the commercial landscape of the implant diagnostics market. Last, but not the least, QUIVER will greatly enhance patient experience, providing patients with peace of mind and reduced uncertainties.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: YifengLiu\n"
