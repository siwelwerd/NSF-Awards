 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the diagnosis of diseases such as pressure ulcers that affect vascular health within the tissue. The goal of this technology is to prevent pressure injuries through early detection, which saves at-risk patients from pain, infection, and decreased quality of life. Hospitals that adopt this technology may be able to decrease their hospital-acquired pressure injury rates, a key quality metric for hospitals, save thousands of dollars in costs per pressure injury averted, and utilize resources effectively. Because the proposed technology may identify non-visible pressure injuries upon admission, it may ensure those ulcers formed prior to hospital stay are treated more promptly. Through tissue health evaluation, pressure injuries may be identified and treated as early as possible to hinder progression to later, more difficult-to-heal stages. Finally, current subjective visual assessments require multiple nurses to examine patients upon admission to the hospital. By monitoring tissue health beneath the skin\u2019s surface, only one nurse (or nurse assistant) is necessary to make the assessment, allowing hospitals to utilize limited personnel resources more efficiently. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, multi-wavelength spectrum analyzer that is designed to assess tissue health.  The proposed technology works by projecting different wavelengths of light on the surface of the tissue and analyzing the properties of the light that are reflected back. The proposed device is designed to measure tissue health metrics such as tissue oxygenation (StO2) and blood perfusion among others. Compared to current assessment methods, the proposed device eliminates the subjectivity associated with visual assessment methods, provides the ability to detect potentially non-visible pressure injuries, and increases accessibility.  The StO2 measurement is also applicable to a wide range of use cases involving tissue health. The proposed device may be utilized for additional applications including peripheral artery disease (PAD) testing, burn assessments, and the evaluation of tissue viability after reconstructive surgery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
