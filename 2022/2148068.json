 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glacial erosion produces large quantities of sediment that can change the chemistry of surrounding land and ocean ecosystems. While the nutrients underneath glaciers are known to be important for nearby biological communities, comparatively less is known about the chemistry and importance of glacier surfaces and snowpack, which can trap dust -  small particles of rock that are deposited by wind and with snowfall. The dust is darker than ice and snow and therefore can warm during sunny periods and melt the surrounding frozen water, generating small amounts of liquid water. During cloudy and cold periods, solar radiation can no longer heat the particles and the liquid water around the dust freezes again. These thawing and freezing cycles can break down the dust and release nutrients, such as iron, which can potentially be used by organisms in the ice or can be transported to streams, lakes, and/or the ocean during periods of high melt. This research will combine computer modeling and laboratory experiments to understand 1) what happens (chemically and physically) to glacier and snowpack dust during freezing and thawing and 2) how to model freezing and thawing of water and dust in glacier ice. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, allowing for diverse audiences to connect with the Antarctic continent and understand how small-scale science influences large-scale systems. The results of this study will determine the geochemistry of glacial meltwater due to freezing and thawing, and whether the meltwater contains critical nutrients for surrounding ecosystems.\r\n\r\nDespite low temperatures and the relative scarcity of liquid water, glacial systems can be a major source of trace metals, nutrients and other weathering products to proglacial and marine systems. While the importance of weathering has been established in subglacial and proglacial environments, less is understood about weathering mechanisms or the composition of major and trace nutrients at the most upstream source: within snow and supraglacial ice. Wind deposits fine-grained sediment on ice surfaces, which can then melt or become incorporated into the ice profile and experience a range of thermal regimes and freeze-thaw conditions. Daily freeze-thaw cycling drives physical and chemical weathering of sediment grains, yet few studies have explicitly examined the frequency and intensity of freeze-thaw cycles and how they control major ion and trace metal release, alteration, and mobility. This interdisciplinary study will use geochemical and energy balance modeling, freeze-thaw experimentation, and scanning electron microscopy to advance knowledge of mineral weathering in ice and snow active layers. Existing samples collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, an ecosystem that relies on runoff derived from supraglacial ice and snow melt, will be utilized. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, the first focused on connecting the macro-scale Antarctic continent to micro-scale microscopy images, and the second a contemporary art exhibit that will explore the Antarctic continent and our perceptions of scale. Findings from this research will contribute to knowledge of nutrient bioavailability and delivery to proglacial environments and polar oceans, watershed-scale weathering in glacial systems, and the conditions that create microsites for life on glaciers and other icy systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
