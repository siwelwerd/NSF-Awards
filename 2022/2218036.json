 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) requests funds for Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) that is needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research. Working within the collaborative framework of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), the proposed equipment will be maintained by the SIO ship operations department for use by NSF-supported scientists from institutions nationwide who require these seagoing facilities. Equipment is requested for RV Sally Ride, a 238-foot, Navy-owned vessel built in 2014 and for R/V Revelle.\r\n\r\nWith this proposal, SIO provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following SSSE:\r\n\r\n\r\nPortable cranes of Revelle and Sally Ride\t$446,800\t\r\nGPS Receiver for Revelle\t$4,360\t\r\nDiaphragm pumps for Revelle and Sally Ride\t$19,492\t\r\nElectric hoist for Revelle hanger bay\t$7,947\t\r\nBlocks for .322\" wire on Revelle and Sally Ride\t$29,662\t\r\nAir Compressors for Revelle and Sally Ride\t$16,090\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$524,351\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
