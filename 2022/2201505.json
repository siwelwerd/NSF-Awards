 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in Missouri are substantially under-resourced and located in less-populated, connectivity-challenged areas. Missouri PUIs vary widely in their experience with advanced networking and High-Performance Computing (HPC) usage. There is wide variability in the adoption of new research and teaching resources including student access to meaningful STEM experiences enabled by a robust Cyberinfrastructure (CI). While PUIs educate about 40% of STEM graduates, in 2020 less than 5% of NSF awards in Missouri went to PUIs.\r\n\r\nThrough the Computational Infusion for Missouri Undergraduate Science and Education (CIMUSE) Planning Grant, Missouri is working on the first in a series of National Science Foundation Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) proposals for robust access to a uniform set of shared resources regardless of geography, proven cyberinfrastructure designs, opportunities for research computing design, and operational support requirements. The CIMUSE planning grant brings interested institutions together for demonstrations and discussion of existing resources, typical CI roles and responsibilities, and potential operational issues. The first wave of researchers, science educators, and campus information technology staff are working to articulate long-term computing and networking needs, document science drivers and required computational resources, and coordinate state research network and campus CI plans for the first wave of CC* proposals.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Missouri Research and Education Network (MOREnet) and first wave PUIs will develop a consistent set of resources to increase the research capabilities at under-resourced institutions, bring robust teaching tools to STEM instructors and provide computation-intensive experiences for STEM students becoming future STEM professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
