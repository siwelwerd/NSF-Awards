 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildfires have been increasing in the American West over the past several decades, which has resulted in extreme public safety and economic problems.  The conditions that lead to significant wildfires are generally known to be high temperature and low moisture.  However, there is still uncertainty about how these conditions form, as studies show that the large-scale circulations cannot explain the strength of the heat and drought in mountainous terrain.  This conference will bring together scientific experts on various topics to discuss the role of different aspects of meteorology on setting the conditions for major wildfires in complex terrain.  In addition to the downstream societal impact of better forecasting conditions for wildfires, the conference will allow students and early-career researchers the opportunity to network and learn from leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThe University of California \u2013 Los Angeles will host a two-day workshop titled \u201cInteraction between wildfire, heatwave, clouds and precipitation over complex topography\u201d in Spring 2023.  The goal of the workshop is to identify the key science questions and gaps of knowledge, to review current observational and modeling capability, and to assess feasibility of a potential field campaign to clarify the key processes behind the interaction between wildfire, heatwave, clouds and precipitation over complex topography.  Specific topics will include: 1) Biomass burning aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction and its potential role in amplifying heatwaves and dry spells, 2) Land-atmospheric interaction and its role in amplifying fire weather over complex topography, and 3) The influence of clouds and aerosols on radiative energy over complex topography.  The conference plan is for in-person and remote participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
