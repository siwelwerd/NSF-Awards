 "awd_abstract_narration": "The EFMA GERMINATION program seeks to promote the development and implementation of novel approaches, platforms, and environments for training academic researchers to formulate societally impactful research questions. This award will provide support for a two-day workshop to be held at Harvey Mudd College in early 2023, which will convene teams funded through the GERMINATION program. This event will build on past meetings by including researchers from both current and completed GERMINATION projects. The 2023 workshop, which is intended as an in-person meeting, will be preceded by a shorter virtual meeting in 2022 to initiate connection building across the GERMINATION teams. These meetings continue the goal of GERMINATION investigator workshops to propel information exchange and further community building, and in particular will explore ways to establish and support relationships beyond the lifetime of individual awards. Broader Impacts are inherent in the goals of the GERMINATION program \u2013 the development of pedagogical frameworks, platforms and/or environments that stimulate formulation of transformative research questions that address important societal needs.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 workshop will bring together GERMINATION awardees and other stakeholders to report and reflect on how their projects have facilitated the formulation of transformative research questions. The planned workshop will provide a unique opportunity to prototype a culture of relational collaboration within the framework of the annual workshops. Non-traditional modes of presentation of research goals, plans, and findings will be explored, with the goal of using fun learning experiences as a mechanism to generate potentially long-term interactions among the participants from different projects. The workshop-organizing PIs have developed a set of workshop principles to guide the activities, including an emphasis on interaction, recognition of interesting and creative approaches, and identification of collaborative connections. Anticipated activities will include exploration of attributes of relational interdisciplinary collaboration, including collaborative foundations, power relationships, means of expression and approaches to risk. Ultimately, the workshop should provide a prototype for a research culture that scaffolds creative collaboration and risk taking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Each year since 2016, Germination researchers have met to share ongoing work and results, build relationships with other researchers, and refresh a sense of excitement about their research. During the pandemic, these workshops became virtual meetings, which had a significant effect on collaboration and communication among participants. For the 2022/2023 meeting, Professors&nbsp;Patrick Little (Engineering, Harvey Mudd College) and Thomas Mairoana (Design, UC Davis) were given the charge of planning and carrying out a return to in-person Germination meetings. We conducted a virtual workshop for 26 attendees in December, 2022 and 20 attendees at an in-person workshop at Harvey Mudd in March, 2023. These events led to being asked to host an additional virtual event in December, 2023 and provide guidance and planning for a second in-person event in May of 2024 at NSF headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>The PIs proposed to use the workshops as a way to establish and support relationships that outlive the length of individual grants, using carefully targeted virtual activities to ignite curiosity and create moments of connection among the participants and preparing them to work together during the in-person events. The virtual workshop also introduced a vocabulary for interdisciplinary collaboration. This leveraged research on relational interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate new ways of connection building through non-traditional modes of presentation. The intent was to use fun learning experiences to generate potentially long-term interactions among the participants from different projects. We developed a set of workshop principles to guide the activities, including an emphasis on interaction, recognition of interesting and creative approaches, and identification of new connections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The participants closed out the virtual event with an exercise called, \"I used to think, and now I think\" which was borrowed from the d.school at Stanford. Examples of participant responses included:</p>\r\n<p><em>- I used to think about collaboration challenges without a structure/framework. Now I think I have a constructive way to think about it!</em></p>\r\n<p><em>- I used to think about collaboration in my silo / now I have new perspectives and tools to approach collaboration better</em></p>\r\n<p><em>- I used to think becoming interdisciplinary was a destination, but now I think becoming interdisciplinary is always ongoing.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>- I used to think it takes a particular mindset to successfully pursue interdisciplinary work, now I think it is possible for anyone to do with a framework.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>- I used to think that interdisciplinary efforts were for certain types of people but I think there is hope for any researcher to engage if willing.</em></p>\r\n<p>Twenty of the Germination awardees participated in an in-person event at Harvey Mudd on March 20 and 21st. Participants shared their research through magazine covers. Each participant was asked to craft their vision of success by imagining a magazine cover from 5 years in the future. A UC Davis graduate student then created realistic looking magazine covers which we used in lieu of PowerPoint Presentations. We balanced this non-traditional approach with a podcast style interview of Pramod Khargonekar on the nature of transformative research and an interactive presentation by the Right Question Institute. An exercise created by Tom Wujec was used to highlight how prototyping can be used in any research setting. We closed out the event through an escape room-style activity that leveraged the discipline of serious games. The game engaged the entire Germination Community and included an elaborate array of puzzles that reinforced the core elements of the conference; community, exchange and interdisciplinary collaboration.. This interactive experience illustrated the needs for multiple viewpoints, experimentation and collaborative problem solving.</p>\r\n<p>The success of the workshops led to an invitation to play an lead role in planning the virtual and in-person events for the following year. Professors Maiorana and Little hosted a virtual event in December of 2023 and then offered programing advice for the in-person event in Arlington in 2024. Once again, the online events followed by a face-to-face gathering proved an excellent way to build up \"connective tissue\" in the germination community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We built upon some key aspects of the 2023 event, and returned to a more traditional slide presentation format with the notable limitation of 2 slides per Germination team. This constraint helped limit project descriptions to their most salient elements. It also helped foster a sense of curiosity in the audience. The nuances of much of the research were barely touched upon by presenters, yet this made for rich follow-up discussions and created ways for the community members to grow deeper connections. Another successful innovation was the use of a graphic recorder to capture ideas and discussions in a non-verbal way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2024<br>\nModified by: Patrick&nbsp;Little</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796376099_Germination_Community_1_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796376099_Germination_Community_1_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Prototyping Together\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796376099_Germination_Community_1_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Prototyping Together\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants learn to collaborate during the Spaghetti Marshmallow exercise.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tom Maiorana</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;Maiorana\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Prototyping Together</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796597805_Germination_Community_1709--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796597805_Germination_Community_1709--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interview with Pramod Khargonekar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796597805_Germination_Community_1709--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interview with Pramod Khargonekar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Patrick Little interviews Pramod Khargonekar as part of the Germination workshop.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tom Maiorana</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;Maiorana\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Interview with Pramod Khargonekar</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796449660_Germination_Community_1596--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796449660_Germination_Community_1596--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Learning through magazine cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2240761/2240761_10831186_1727796449660_Germination_Community_1596--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Learning through magazine cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants interviewed each other to learn about the key parts of their Germination projects.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tom Maiorana</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;Maiorana\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Learning through magazine cover</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
