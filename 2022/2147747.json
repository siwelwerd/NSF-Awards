 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines existing observational data with updated model simulations to address current knowledge gaps regarding new particle formation, particularly new particles being formed in proximity to clouds in the marine boundary layer. This work provides a much-needed integration of various observational datasets with state-of-the-science simulations and has the potential to fill existing knowledge gaps and advance our understanding of how clouds are formed. Clouds over the ocean are particularly important with regard to solar radiation and the energy budget so research examining cloud processes over the ocean will enhance our understanding of our atmosphere and our climate.\r\n\r\nThis project includes three primary tasks. The first task seeks to identify the conditions under which new particle formation (NPF) occurs and the main drivers of NPF within the marine boundary layer (MBL) via analysis of existing field measurements including airborne and surface (ground site and research cruise) observations. The observational datasets are pulled from field campaigns across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The second task seeks to investigate the mechanism behind MBL NPF via state-of-the-science simulations using the large eddy simulation (LES) formulation of the WRF-Chem model constrained by the field observations from the first task. Finally, the third task will run additional WRF-Chem simulations under representative conditions in order to quantify the impact of MBL NPF on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud microphysics and the resultant regional impact on MBL clouds. \r\n\r\nThis effort includes support and training for a postdoctoral researcher.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
