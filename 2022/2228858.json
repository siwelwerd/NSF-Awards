 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Strengthening Community in Research Mathematics will take place February 17-18, 2023 in Claremont, California.  The conference will strengthen the mathematical research community by gathering researchers in cutting-edge mathematics,  highlighting the strategic role and importance of our professional organizations, and by disseminating successful strategies to enable mathematicians from traditionally underrepresented groups to flourish. The conference will not only enhance the flow of talent into the mathematics research community but  also help upgrade the demographic reach and capabilities of the entire STEM pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe conference will achieve its goals in several ways.  General audience research talks will be in the core fields of number theory and algebraic geometry and will be designed to facilitate future collaborations while providing a supportive environment for young mathematicians from underserved backgrounds to experience the beauty and power of number theory and algebraic geometry. We will also address relevant questions that undergraduate and graduate students have about the profession with talks and panel discussions on the graduate school admission and matriculation process, navigating the mathematical discipline as a member of a currently underrepresented group, the multitude of career opportunities that one can pursue with a graduate degree in mathematics, and managing academic and nonacademic job ladders. Faculty will in turn participate in talks and panel discussions that address mentoring students from underrepresented groups and how to engage undergraduates in their research.  For more information, visit the conference web-page \r\nhttps://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics-statistics/events-colloquia/conference-strengthening-community-research-mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
