 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ADVANCE Catalyst Research, Educate, and Value Equity at All Levels in STEM (REVEALS) project at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania aims to identify and address systemic inequities affecting STEM faculty and the entire University community, which is important to better understand and to change the underrepresentation of women, especially women of color, and other groups in STEM disciplines both locally and nationally. The REVEALS project will examine the faculty experience at Kutztown and underlying causes of inequity with constant consideration of intersectional aspects of identity. This project will study underlying drivers of inequity for women and underrepresented faculty, including a lack of work-life balance, recognition for work that is invisible or undervalued, and sense of belonging within one\u2019s academic unit and institution\u2014all of which serve as barriers to tenure, retention in academia, and scientific advances. The project will use data collection, analysis, institutional self-assessment, and knowledge sharing from other ADVANCE projects to better understand drivers of inequity and barriers to the retention and advancement of underrepresented STEM faculty. The project will pilot a faculty equity advocate position and an online clearinghouse to centralize and improve access to needed faculty resources. The REVEALS project\u2019s formative assessment will lead to the creation of a five-year equity strategic plan responsive to faculty equity challenges through sustainable, tailored strategies. Grounded in the theory of intersectionality and deploying evidence-informed strategies modeled through ADVANCE resources and other institutions nationwide, REVEALS is intended to substantially contribute to the knowledge base in improving equity in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the REVEALS project are to collect data to identify STEM faculty inequities; analyze existing and novel data to determine drivers of inequity and barriers to retention and advancement of underrepresented STEM faculty; identify potential solutions and implement pilot equity strategies; and create a five-year equity strategic plan for faculty in STEM that is linked to Kutztown University\u2019s strategic plan. The qualitative and quantitative research methods of the REVEALS project include gathering and synthesizing existing institutional data; developing and administering a comprehensive faculty survey that focuses on family obligations, a sense of belonging and connectedness, and service commitments/ invisible labor; conducting semi-structured interviews and focus groups with campus leaders and administrators, existing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion groups, and women faculty, including women of color; reviewing institutional policies; and studying other institutions with ADVANCE grants. The comprehensive scope of this study is intended to enable Kutztown University to implement cultural systemic shifts in STEM equity. The REVEALS project will be documented in an online site, and results will be disseminated within Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) schools, the ADVANCE community, and nationally. \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at academic, non-profit institutions of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
