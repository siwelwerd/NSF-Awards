 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Quantum Technologies (CQT) is a partnership between Purdue University, Indiana University (Bloomington and Indiana University Purdue University - Indianapolis Campuses), and the University of Notre Dame. The mission of the CQT is to collaborate with industry and government stakeholders to identify compelling needs and challenges in quantum technologies, and then develop novel solutions to address these opportunities. Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the four universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nAs one of the Center sites, the University of Notre Dame will leverage its existing Centers and industrial relationships to drive quantum research in the areas of advanced materials and devices, quantum simulations of physical phenomena such as spin chemistry, quantum algorithms for data sciences and machine learning, and high-performance computing systems architectures. For example, the ASCENT Center is a consortium of 13 universities led by Notre Dame, with a goal to provide breakthrough advances in integrated nanoelectronics, with devices based on quantum effects. The QCLab (Quantum Computing Laboratory) has the mission to serve as an internationally-recognized, multidisciplinary quantum computing hub, based upon accelerating discovery through effective and novel applications of quantum computing algorithms, software tools, and devices. Also, the CNDS (Center for Network and Data Science) was founded to generate fundamental and transformative advances in AI, Network, and Data Science, and can serve as both motivating cases for quantum applications and sources of data for driving quantum codes. In addition, multi-year research by multiple faculty have gained internationally recognized expertise in the relationship between very high-performance computing architectures, emerging technologies, emerging applications areas (such as machine learning), and tools to support efficient execution of highly parallel algorithms. Notre Dame also supports a broad effort in Workforce Development. The Center for STEM Education is part of a long-running Notre Dame effort to advance the teaching and learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The Center for Civic Innovation has as a vision to create a virtuous cycle wherein faculty and students analyze challenging problems and develop co-creation of knowledge among a broad network of partners. Finally, iNDustry Labs is the Notre Dame component of the LIFT (Labs for Industry Futures and Transformation) network that was launched with a $42M grant from the Lilly Endowment, with a charter to enhance skill attainment, research, commercialization, and innovation across the South Bend - Elkhart Region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
