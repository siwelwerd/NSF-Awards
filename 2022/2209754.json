 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed Center for Wireless Innovation towards Secure, Pervasive, Efficient, and Resilient Next Generation Networks (WISPER) will coordinate academia, industry, and government to pioneer transformative next generation (NextG) wireless technologies for key industry verticals. Our missions include: (1) growing the U.S. innovation capacity in the next-generation wireless networks; (2) catalyzing breakthrough pre-competitive research for enabling NextG wireless communications; (3) contributing to the emerging North American vision for the next generation wireless networks; (4) providing guidance to standardization bodies and cooperation partners; and (5) producing a workforce prepared to tackle complex next-generation wireless challenges.\r\n\r\nWISPER will focus on developing transformative wireless innovations. Areas of research include but are not limited to: (1) exploration of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing and Resource Allocation algorithms  in NextG considering performance, efficiency, resilience, and security and privacy; (2) Secure mmWave Communications with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces;  (3) Reliable mmWave wireless LANs through coordination; (4) development of advanced trust management functionality for virtual networks, trust management and invocation using butterfly keying schemas, trusted computing bases and post- quantum cryptography to support NextG wireless communications; (5) resilient ML-based RAN Slice Management in NextG; and (6) development of an industry-guided workforce development program in the context of next-generation wireless networks. \r\n\r\nThe proposed WISPER Center will contribute significantly to the country's future communication infrastructure, with broader impacts on diversity and inclusion, workforce development, and technology transfer. A Diversity & Inclusion Committee will be formed to review the current diversity and inclusion profile and develop specific measures and plans for inspiring the participation of underrepresented groups.  WISPER will prepare students to become proficient in NextG techniques, leading to transformative changes in the state of wireless workforce preparedness. WISPER will enable seamless integration of the center's new discoveries into NextG wireless systems, accelerating technology transfer, enhancing the competence of the industrial members, and contributing to the Nation\u2019s leadership in NextG technologies. \r\n\r\nAll data, software, and artifacts produced in this project will be archived and preserved, according to standard institutional security and privacy practices and policies, for at least five years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
