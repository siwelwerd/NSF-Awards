 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement & Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry and partial co-funding from the Divisions of Physics (Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics - Experiment) and Materials Research (Condensed Matter Physics), Professor Meriles at The City University of New York is developing new imaging techniques that leverage the special physical properties of select light emitters in diamond. Capitalizing on cutting-edge instrumentation and recent methodological progress, the central goal of this project is to enhance the information content of observed signals and broaden the techniques\u2019 applicability in areas such as soft condensed matter and biological systems, semiconducting polymers, and other energy-relevant organic or inorganic materials. The project offers students a unique inter-disciplinary scientific education and the ability to interact with a wide network of collaborators, including scientists at Adamas Nanotechnologies, a company contributing to the project through a range of activities that leverage their extensive expertise in diamond synthesis, processing, and surface functionalization. The partnership not only provides a broad dissemination platform but also allows the PI to advance ongoing outreach programs designed to provide meaningful research experiences to underprivileged students through summer and/or year-round activities at CUNY/CCNY.\r\n\r\nWith the overarching goal of enhancing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) scanning microscopy as a broad magnetic-resonance-based imaging and characterization technique, work in the Meriles lab focuses on two related research thrusts: \r\n(i) Investigation of the ensemble of paramagnetic centers in all-diamond scanning tips to gain improved understanding of tip composition and dynamics, for applications to new forms of NV scanning imaging, with emphasis on ancilla-spin-aided relaxometry. Included is the use of spectrally-resolved spin-noise detection schemes relying on easy-to-use, AI (artificial intelligence)-assisted protocols for spectral density reconstruction. \r\n(ii) Study of interactions between the NV and individual electron and nuclear spins in proximity, as a means to enhanced sensing based on non-Hermitian dynamics. This thrust includes studies aimed at engineering \u201cprotected\u201d NV spin states featuring long coherence lifetimes, and their application to electric-noise-selective sensing. \r\nThe overall project aims to extend the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), not only its sensitivity and spatial resolution, but also the types of materials and processes that can be probed using NV magnetometry while retaining key traits that make MRI versatile (particularly its ability to obtain spectroscopic fingerprints and introduce different forms of contrast), and capitalizing on the spatial precision and enhanced sensitivity of optical and atomic force microscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
