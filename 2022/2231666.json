 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the attendance of US-based participants in the 2022 Congress of the Pacific Rim Mathematical Association (PRIMA), hosted by the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in December 2022. The Congress helps mathematical scientists to build new and strengthen existing collaborations across the Pacific Rim. A strong US presence at this conference is a steppingstone to wider US participation in mathematical activities in the Pacific Rim.\r\n\r\nThe Congress includes scientific sessions on Algebraic Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry, Arithmetic Geometry, Enumerative Algebraic Geometry, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Group Theory, Graph Theory and Combinatorics, Harmonic Functions and Laplace Eigenfunctions, Mathematics of Information, Moduli Spaces in Algebraic Geometry, Geometry and Mathematical Physics, Optimal Transport and Applications, and Representation Theory and Applications. The Pacific Rim Mathematical Association was founded in 2005, and currently consists of 48 member institutions around the Pacific Rim. The PRIMA charter calls for PRIMA to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of scientific knowledge via a quadrennial Pacific Rim Congress. PRIMA Congresses have been held in 2009 (Sydney), 2013 (Shanghai), and 2017 (Oaxaca). \r\n\r\nAdditional information can be found on the meeting web site https://prima2022.primamath.org/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
