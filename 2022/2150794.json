 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of building capacity for the purpose of preparing high-quality teachers in mathematics, science, and computer science. Through an educational partnership, the goal of this project is to revise and develop curricula for preparing future teachers of mathematics, science, and computer science. In addition, this project proposes to improve the pathway for the recruitment, education, and retention of those future teachers in urban public schools. This will be accomplished by understanding the local needs for mathematics, science, and computer science teachers in urban settings, including understanding how to improve teacher preparation programs to meet such needs. This Capacity Building project is expected to lay the groundwork for the future preparation and submission of a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program proposal. \r\n\r\nThis project at Texas Wesleyan University (TWU), a private primarily undergraduate serving university, includes partnerships with Tarrant County College District, an open-access community college district; the Fort Worth Independent School District, a high-need school district; Leadership Academy Network, a community-based organization; and the University of Texas at Arlington, a public research university. Project goals are to (1) strengthen the existing mathematics and science teacher certification tracks and develop a new Grade 7-12 computer science teacher certification track at TWU; (2) strengthen and expand partnerships with Fort Worth K-12 and postsecondary institutions, with an intentional focus on the recruitment, preparation, and retention of STEM teachers; and (3) establish, maintain, and expand Fort Worth community-based STEM outreach partnerships. To accomplish these goals, this project will utilize an extensive catalog of needs assessments to advance knowledge, increase STEM teacher effectiveness, enhance infrastructure, and advocate for underrepresented populations. This project will build an understanding of best practices for building a pathway for recruiting future STEM teachers from urban school districts into two-year and four-year institutions, with the goal of returning these students to the urban school districts as highly qualified STEM teachers. In this way, the project will create a positive feedback loop for teacher preparation. Additionally, this project seeks to examine the Leadership Academy Network model, a public charter school, as a teaching laboratory for early field experiences with first- and second-year undergraduate students who have interests in STEM education. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
