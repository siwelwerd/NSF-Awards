 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community-engaged soil sensing is essential for confronting the challenge of toxic pollution\u2014specifically arsenic and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\u2014in human environments. This project uses bacteria as sensors of soil contaminants, ultimately leading to the production of paper-based \u201ctest strips\u201d that generate a quantitative reading of contaminant concentrations in soil. Such biosensors can support basic science as well as community-engaged investigations of exposure pathways. The project uses a \u201cresponsible research and innovation\u201d (RRI) framework, which means including stakeholders\u2014particularly citizen scientists\u2014in the research process to enhance capacity to anticipate consequences of different sensor designs, reflect on the researchers\u2019 assumptions, and respond to stakeholder needs and values.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to create a biohybrid device that can exploit and tune the strengths of both electronic and biological sensing with the invention of a dynamic bioelectronic interface. By separating the actuation and sensing stages with different bacteria, a transfer function between signal gain and system stability can be engineered and customized toward community sensing needs. Development of the device involves pursuit of four interdependent aims: 1) engaging stakeholders through citizen science and an advisory board in order to inform research priorities and approaches, 2) using two different bacteria that function as the sensing front end (E.coli) and electroactive backend (S. oneidensis) to produce arsenic detection at detection levels comparable to current standards, 3) experimentation with electroactive bacteria species (P. aeroginosa) to advance toward a PFAS biosensor, and 4) iterative development of a paper-based sensor design that is suitable for community-based environmental monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award was made through the \"Signals in the Soil (SitS)\" solicitation, a collaborative partnership between the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
