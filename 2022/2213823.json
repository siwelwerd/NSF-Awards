 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on community formation and planning activities related to TopoCloud, a new testbed for network experimentation. Compared to earlier network testbeds, TopoCloud will give experimenters the ability to see and modify a datacenter network's topology -- that is, the way in which its components are interconnected. To provide experimenters with exclusive, low-level access to programmable networking devices, all user-controlled networking devices in TopoCloud will be connected to an operator-controlled network. This network will be used to dynamically \u201crewire\u201d servers and devices to physically create private networks that are guaranteed to run at full speed.\r\n\r\nServices provided by clouds and datacenters are at the core of much of the online world, supporting websites, apps, and even medical devices. The networks inside of these datacenters are critical determinants of the datacenter's performance, robustness, and cost. TopoCloud will be a unique resource that enables transformative research on the ways that datacenter networks are built and managed. As a result, it aims to enable research that will improve performance and lower costs in the networks that form the foundation for many of the services used in people\u2019s daily lives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
