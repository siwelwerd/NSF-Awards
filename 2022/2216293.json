 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum technology is poised to enable an abrupt change (or a quantum leap) in human capability for computing, communications, and sensing.  Scaling up quantum systems, or in other words, increasing computational space, communication distance and measurement sensitivity, is the key for the success of real applications. Integrating quantum photonic components onto a single platform, significantly reduces the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), while simultaneously enhancing the power and phase stability, scalability, and manufacturability. Photonics is viewed as an enabling technology for quantum applications. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) technology offers several critical advantages and provides a versatile testbed for quantum experiments and resources for measurement-based quantum computing, high-dimensional entanglement, quantum communications, quantum information processing and quantum machine learning. Many applications, such as quantum simulators, machine learning, and graph-based computation have a natural implementation by quantum photonics. Furthermore, photonics serves as a tool by which theoretical predictions of topological phenomena can be tested, which has led to the rapid development of topological phases of matter. Topology has also contributed to the growth of photonics by enabling its robust control, even for imperfect devices, and by promoting practical devices for applications in telecommunications, metrology, sensing and processing.  As quantum devices and systems are transitioning from theory to practice, and there is a growing interest from research institutions and the private sector, the shortage of skilled scientist and engineers has been identified.  Hence, it is not difficult to overemphasize the importance of a solid background in these technologies and the hands-on experience of future science and engineering graduates.  An increasing role of technological innovations in local and global economies, and growing competition among technologically advanced nations, makes student training in quantum devices and systems field vital for the US in 21st century.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this MRI is the acquisition of a unique state-of-the-art automated photonics alignment/probe station with a high brightness Photon-Pair source and a dual channel Ultra-low-noise Photon Counter that will enable the characterization of quantum devices and systems.  It will enable optical and electronic measurements of multiport quantum devices and systems, thus, addressing the needs for reliable and repeatable measurements, while at the same time minimizing alignment related losses, which are of critical importance in quantum experiments.  The characterization of quantum devices in the early stage of the development is critical for their further optimization, as it provides important feedback that allow for device improvements. The characterization station will enable unique measurement capabilities to faculty, researchers, and students at CCNY and will complement fabrication facilities and modeling and simulation capabilities available to the CCNY community.  The project will provide opportunities for training to the diverse graduate and undergraduate student body at CCNY, where many of the students are from underrepresented groups.  The students will gain experience on the entire spectrum of design-fabrication-testing and characterization of integrated quantum photonic devices. We anticipate that the facility will attract researchers beyond CCNY and will foster further collaborations, which can lead to more scientific interaction and exchange of ideas among the participating researchers. Finally, small/medium size businesses may benefit in the development of their products, by getting access to the proposed system and through collaborative efforts.  This will enable the generation of important knowhow and transfer of knowledge from/to CCNY, training of students and development of new scientific knowledge and products that will benefit the US economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
