 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the workshop WINART3, Women in Noncommutative Algebra and Representation Theory, held at the Banff International Research Station, Banff, Canada on April 3-8, 2022. The goal of the workshop is to bring together experts and junior participants working in these fields to collaborate on research projects, and its primary focus is to facilitate research activities. There will be eight research groups consisting of four to six participants, each led by two research leaders. Each group will come to the workshop with a prepared plan and project and spend most of the workshop working on their respective projects. The workshop will also feature several introductory, as well as more advanced, talks, and professional development activities. This structure was very successful in previous workshops in the series: WINART1 in 2016 and WINART2 in 2019.\r\n\r\nThe fields of noncommutative algebra and representation theory have long been closely intertwined, but even more so since the emergence of quantum groups in the 1980s. The results in these fields have been significant in their own right and also have had a strong influence in shaping other fields such as conformal field theory, the study of operator algebras, string theory, topological field theory, and the various forms of noncommutative geometry. There will be a variety of research topics present at the WINART3 workshop: cluster theory, Hopf algebras and their representation theory, weak Hopf algebras and their actions on algebras, infinite-dimensional Lie theory, and Hochschild cohomology. The workshop website is: https://women-in-ncalg-repthy.org/conferences/winart3-workshop/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
