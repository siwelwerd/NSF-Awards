 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blockchains and cryptocurrencies have emerged as disruptive technologies with profound financial and societal impact.  This state of affairs makes it imperative to gain better understanding of the dynamics and resilience of the underlying peer-to-peer networks on which blockchains operate.  To this end, this project researches novel measurement methodologies, statistical modeling, and design approaches for distributed consensus on these peer-to-peer networks.  The research aims to empower a broader participation of users worldwide, including those with limited network access, and to support the decentralization and trust elements that are key to the continued success of blockchain technologies.\r\n \r\nBlockchains have seen soaring adoption by large corporations and small investors alike.  This project contributes to educating stakeholders and the general public about the benefits and risks of these technologies.  In a similar vein, the project seeks to leverage the popularity of blockchains to broaden participation in computing with innovative engagement of undergraduate and high school students.  The methodologies produced by this project promise to benefit adjacent research areas with similar challenges, including within the databases and distributed computing communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
