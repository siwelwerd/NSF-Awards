 "awd_abstract_narration": "In temperate forests, most plant species are understory wildflowers. The seasonal timing of biological events such as leaf out, flowering, and seed production is especially critical for forest wildflowers that rely on high light in the spring, before trees leaf out and reduce light to the forest floor. New research suggests the timing of leaf out of overstory trees may shift faster than understory wildflowers in response to warmer spring temperatures. Such mismatches in leaf out timing of different plant species could reduce wildflower populations and affect forest diversity and productivity. The early leaf out times and dense foliage of nonnative, invasive shrubs could further reduce light levels for native wildflowers. This project explores how warming temperatures may cause a mismatch in lifecycle events of trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Specifically, the project measures whether trees, shrubs, and flowers respond differently to temperature cues, whether this mismatch is a global phenomenon, and how this affects the ability of wildflowers to grow and reproduce. This project connects the public interest in forests to environmental variability and invasive species. The public can access the results through popular media, public lectures, and social media. The project team will develop training for museum educators so they can infuse themes of forest change into exhibits and conversations with museum visitors. In collaboration with museum educators, the project will host K-12 teacher workshops to integrate forest monitoring and local examples of environmental variability into school curricula. \r\n\r\nDirect measurements of the consequences of environment-induced phenological mismatches between interacting species are rare, and disruptions in non-trophic competitive interactions between plant species are often overlooked. In addition, related impacts of species invasions are not well integrated into phenological studies. The impacts of these phenological disruptions may be contributing to widely-observed population declines and poor performance of species that weakly respond to warming temperatures. This project will uniquely combine historical records (observations of Henry David Thoreau), contemporary phenological monitoring, museum herbarium collections, and field experiments to document and understand ecological mismatches between forest trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Field shading experiments will simulate effects of environmental variability, species invasions, and ecological mismatches on wildflower performance. Field and growth chamber experiments will test mechanisms determining leaf-out phenology. Thousands of recently digitized herbarium specimens will be leveraged to quantify how overstory-understory temporal mismatch varies across temporal, climatic, and biogeographic gradients.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Farmers, gardeners, and plant lovers may notice that the timing of spring green-up and flowering is starting earlier than in previous years. Plants use many clues--like day length, temperature and precipitation--to decide when it is spring. Scientists think that we are seeing earlier springs because temperatures are, on average, warmer than they were decades ago.</p>\n<p>Ecologists have also noticed an early shift in the timing of plant leaf-out and flowering across nearly all of earth&rsquo;s ecosystems. Some spring plants are emerging or flowering up to 1-2 weeks earlier than a few decades ago. But ecologists have also noticed something interesting: varying rates of spring emergence among different plant species. For instance, while a plant may bloom 8 days earlier than a decade ago, its pollinators, like bumblebees, may not have adjusted their timing at all.&nbsp;Changes in the relative timing of species&rsquo; life activities are called &lsquo;phenological mismatches&rsquo; and ecologists want to know two questions: Why are phenological mismatches happening? And When might phenological mismatches change how species grow, reproduce, and persist into the future?</p>\n<p>We explored these questions about forest trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Prior research relying on notes from the American naturalist Henry David Thoreau showed that plants around Walden Pond are emerging earlier that in Thoreau&rsquo;s time, and that forest trees are advancing their leaf growth faster than the wildflowers growing beneath tree canopies. This is a potentially consequential phenological mismatch, if trees are reducing the total amount of early spring sunlight for wildflowers. Lost sunlight may have reduced the total energy budget of today&rsquo;s wildflowers in Walden&rsquo;s Woods by 25% compared to Thoreau&rsquo;s time. Less light and energy could lead to slower wildflower growth and reproduction, which could reduce their long-term survival and the animals that rely on them for food.&nbsp;Trees are not the only forest plant be blocking light for forest wildflowers. Forests also contain shrubs, and since Thoreau&rsquo;s time the forests of eastern North America are beginning to fill up with shrubs that humans brought from Europe and Asia to plant in their home gardens. These shrubs also block light from reaching forest wildflowers, but whether they also leading to phenological mismatches is not known.</p>\n<p>Based on this prior research, we investigated the following questions:</p>\n<p>First, we wanted to know whether the phenological mismatch at Walden Pond was happening in other places? To answer this question, we used museum records of plants collected over the past century to track the timing of forest tree and herb spring phenology in temperate forests of eastern North America, western Europe, and eastern Asia. We found that forest trees and wildflowers around the globe have earlier spring phenology now than in the past, but that only in North America do we find evidence of phenological mismatch between trees and wildflowers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, we wanted to know whether warm temperatures&mdash;in either the winter or the spring&mdash;were the cause of phenological mismatches? To answer this question, we observed the spring phenology of forest trees, shrubs and wildflowers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for two years. We also conducted lab experiments where we measured plant phenology to different temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also found evidence of phenological mismatches between trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. We also found that under some warming conditions, introduced shrubs were leafing out at the same time as wildflowers under spring warming.</p>\n<p>Our final question was what is the possible impact of phenological mismatch on wildflower growth and reproduction? To answer this question, we set up a large &lsquo;common garden&rsquo; experiment where we planted almost 600 individual wildflowers into a forest.
