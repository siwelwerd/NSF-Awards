 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant roots are surrounded by billions of microscopic organisms called bacteria.  These bacteria help the plant obtain nutrients and grow.  Because of how important bacteria are, many people are interested in developing fertilizers containing bacteria to help plants grow better.  However, it has become clear that while some bacteria, when added to a growing plant, can help them grow under artificial laboratory conditions, hardly any bacteria can help a plant grow when applied under realistic conditions.  We would like to understand why some bacteria are able to help plants grow, while some bacteria cannot.  To do this, we will study the genes that growth-promoting bacteria have, and determine whether these genes can convert a non-growth-promoting bacteria into a growth-promoting one.  This work will be performed in corn, and will train one graduate student.\r\n\r\nBeneficial microorganisms can greatly improve crop plant performance, motivating their use as seed inoculants. However, exogenous microbes are often outcompeted in the field, which limits their utility and reveals fundamental gaps in our understanding of root colonization. The rationale for this proposal is that the genes that are most important for colonizing the root are largely unknown. Recent work using comparative genomics and knockout mutants has provided the first insights into the genes involved in root colonization. However, a complete picture of colonization must include how to enhance it, an understanding that is not currently available. Since root colonization is multifaceted (encompassing interactions with other microbes, the host, and abiotic soil conditions) it is expected that a diversity of microbial and plant genes will impact root colonization. To parse this complexity, we will use a functional metagenomics approach to screen for genes conferring improved colonization maize under three different nutrient conditions. This work will therefore advance our understanding of root colonization and our ability to identify microbes that exert beneficial effects for prolonged periods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe microbes that live in and on the plant root help the plant grow and obtain nutrients. Therefore, it is important to understand how those microbes work, and how to improve them, to enable us to use microbes as treatments to improve plant growth. Prior to this project, many of the microbes that lived on plant roots were difficult to genetically engineer, which in turn made it difficult to understand how they were able to help plants grow. In this project, we focused on the microbes that live on corn. We first developed a set of genetic tools for 5 microbes that live on corn roots, allowing us to turn gene expression on and off, and to express proteins that did not originate from those microbes. This toolkit, the Maize Root Microbiome Toolkit (MRMTK) allowed us to label corn root microbes with fluorescent proteins, which should be useful for visualizing where those microbes live on the root. The MRMTK has also been made available to the broader research community. Then, with this toolkit, we wished to tackle another problem that companies face when trying to produce microbes that improve plant growth: applied microbes cannot colonize the plant root over a long period of time, and commonly get wiped out by the microbes that are present in the surrounding soil. This challenge reflects a poor understanding of how microbes colonize roots, and presents an opportunity to discover genes that enhance the colonization of microbes on plant roots. We focused on one corn microbe, Pseudomonas putida, and used our toolkit to search through millions of genes present in the soil for those genes that improve Pseudomonas's persistence on the root. We found one gene, which has not been studied before, seems to do just this. We are now performing experiments to determine whether these results are repeatable and if so, how this gene is able to improve Pseudomonas's persistence on the plant root.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NathanCCrook\n"
