 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networked systems in general, and the Internet in particular, are complex systems involving many interacting components. Network control algorithms implemented in numerous network protocols are at the core of these systems. To date, the design and analysis of network control algorithms has been based on heuristics and idealized models of networks, without any guarantees on their performance in practice. This proposal aims to address this shortcoming and develop methods to prove performance properties of network control algorithms and to synthesize algorithms with performance proofs. \r\n\r\nInnovations in network control algorithms are occurring at a rapid pace, spurred by evolving network technologies, a fast-changing application mix, and the rising importance of quality-of-experience for users, who react negatively to poor performance (e.g., by giving applications poor ratings or finding alternatives). Performance matters not only in the mean, but also in the tail statistics. In response, the research community and industry have developed numerous innovative network control algorithms to improve performance. Despite these advances, little is known about performance guarantees of such algorithms, nor is there is principled proof-driven framework to help the development of these algorithms. The research proposed herein will, if successful, improve the community's ability to verify performance properties and synthesize new algorithms with provable properties. The tools produced in the proposed work will open new directions in network resource allocation research. The education plan includes the incorporation of this research's findings into the undergraduate and graduate curricula and offers students an opportunity to implement verifiable network control algorithms using the tools from Veritas, treating performance as correctness.\r\n\r\nThis proposal develops a framework, Veritas, which uses formal verification to prove performance properties of a network control algorithm. With Veritas a user can (1) encode an algorithm in first-order logic, (2) specify a hypothesis about the algorithm, and (3) test if the hypothesis holds by running the encoded algorithm in a customizable, built-in environment model. In addition, given constraints on a control algorithm---input observations usable by the algorithm and an action space over which it can respond to observations---along with the environment model encoded in first-order logic and a specification of performance objectives, Veritas automatically searches over the space of controllers to propose a mapping between input observations and controller actions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
