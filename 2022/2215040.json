 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Murray State University is acquiring a gel permeation chromatography system with dynamic light scattering detection (GPC/DLS) to support the research of Professor Kevin Miller and colleagues Gary Stinchcomb, Bikram Subedi, Christopher Lennon, and Grace Eder. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, biological sciences, and Earth and environmental sciences. GPC separates molecules as a function of size based on their elution from a packed column. DLS is subsequently used, in-line, to measure time-dependent fluctuations in scattered light, which is related to molecular diffusion coefficeints and their size distributions. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. The instrument is leveraged in research training opportunities in polymer chemistry, molecular biology, and environmental science. Students gain hands-on experience with the instrument through its integration in various courses.\r\n\r\nThe award of the GPC/DLS is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as polymer chemistry, molecular biology, and environmental science. Research focuses on molecular weight analysis of ionenes and cellulose functionalized with ionic liquids and poly(ionic liquids). Other investigations include the separation and analysis of drug residues and other small molecules from biological tissue, environmental samples, and wastewater. It also assists in analyzing molecular weight distributions of copolymers for organic photovoltaics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
