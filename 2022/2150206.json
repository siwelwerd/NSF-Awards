 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) award to Clark Atlanta University, located in Atlanta, Georgia, supports the training of a total of 9 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. This REU site, supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Human Resource Development HBCU-UP program, provides undergraduate students with a challenging research experience in applying data science methods to problems in materials chemistry. In addition to research, the REU program includes a two-week data science bootcamp, scientific seminars, professional development workshops, oral presentations, an end of program symposium, and multiple social activities. Student recruitment focuses on African American and other underrepresented students, students from Minority Serving Institutions, and students from institutions with limited research opportunities. \r\n\r\nTraining the next generation of material scientists at the intersection of materials chemistry and data science is a key to accelerating materials materials innovation . The REU program: (1) provides undergraduates with an early research experience in applying data science to problems in chemistry with the focus on publishing the results, (2) prepares undergraduates for graduate studies in STEM and the STEM professional workforce, and (3) contributes to the diversification of the STEM workforce. The project will achieve these objectives through the following key elements. The two-week data science bootcamp upskills students in data science and its role in chemistry. The research projects investigate applications of data science techniques to accelerate materials innovation and the identification of structure-property relationships. Research topics include applying data science methods to the development of crystalline porous materials, perovskites for 2-dimensional layered oxide materials, graphene and graphene nanoribbons for nanoscale functional interfaces, and non-sustainable petroleum-based composites. Professional development opportunities engage students in a series of workshops on topics necessary for future success in STEM. Scientific seminars highlight the work of underrepresented minority researchers who are active in the application of data science to problems in chemistry. The end-of-program symposium provides participants an opportunity to present their work to the broader community. The project activities will position students to acquire valuable professional skills while making significant contributions to chemistry through data science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
