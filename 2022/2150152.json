 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University will host a diverse group of students from universities across the nation to engage in intensive summer research experiences.  Students will work closely with faculty and graduate student mentors studying pervasive computing systems that can be used in everyday objects to provide services that are reactive to conditions of the changing environment, often with little or no interaction from a human user. Through their research projects, REU Site students will design, implement, and evaluate pervasive computing solutions that advance health, safety, and well-being. The research is led by an experienced faculty team that will provide research training and project-based experiences that balance computer science theory, applications, and practical skills, and the program also provides professional development opportunities for the students. The REU Site focuses on recruiting students from historically excluded groups in computing and emphasizes including students from undergraduate institutions where there are limited research opportunities.\r\n\r\n    The project is a renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University. The REU Site will recruit students from historically excluded groups in computing and create a collaborative working environment where students work closely with each other and with faculty and graduate student mentors.  Research projects will focus on the creation and study of pervasive computing systems that employ sensing, actuation, and computation embedded in everyday objects, landscapes, and wearable items to improve the health, safety, and well-being of the general public. In collaboration with faculty and graduate students, students will have the opportunity to conduct research that has the potential to advance knowledge within the field of pervasive computing and its component areas of networking, computer vision, and human-centered data science. Throughout the course of the program, students will also have the opportunity to participate in professional development activities hosted by the REU Site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
