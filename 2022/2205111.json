 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the health and well-being of animals, particularly respiratory infections in dogs commonly known as kennel cough. More than 5 million veterinarian visits a year in the United States alone are due to kennel cough. In 90% of those cases, dogs are treated based on empirical data, which means veterinarians take an educated guess, and fewer than 10% are tested. Dogs are more likely to develop clinical signs of kennel cough the longer they are in a group-housing environment.  The 5 million cases in the United States are underestimated and do not typically include cases from kennels, shelters, and/or boarding facilities. With the current procedures, veterinarians may send samples to central laboratories that take many days to provide results. The proposed project will develop a diagnostic test that will provide veterinarians with a cost-effective, easy-to-use single test that can detect a wide range of organisms. The test will provide results within minutes of sample collection. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will demonstrate the initial feasibility of detecting several pathogens in a single test device. The selected pathogens will be a combination of bacteria and viruses that have been identified to cause kennel cough in dogs, a common but debilitating ailment. The proposed work will allow test validation, prototype manufacturing, clinical sample evaluation, and procedures to report results to both veterinarians and pet owners.  The innovation will help fill the extensive gaps in understanding the disease ecology, prevalence, incidence, and geographic distribution of kennel cough, facilitating faster and more efficient disease management decisions. The ability to rapidly identify the contagious pathogens involved in an occurrence will permit a rapid response to limit the dimensions of a possible outbreak.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
