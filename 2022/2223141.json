 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey (1931 to present) is the only long-term and ocean-basin-wide in-situ survey of plankton in the world. This award continues the CPR survey in the western Atlantic from Iceland to the eastern margin of the United States. It uses a consistent, cost-effective methodology deployed from ships-of-opportunity to continue a unique and invaluable time series of phytoplankton and zooplankton observations in the surface ocean. The primary objective of this project is to maintain the spatial and temporal integrity of the CPR time series and facilitate marine ecological research. Because plankton form the base of the marine food web, long-term and basin-scale observations allow us to understand how marine ecosystems respond to stressors such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, and loss of biodiversity from fishing pressure, ultimately enabling ecosystem-based management of marine resources. Broader impacts include contributions to U.S. and international and integrated observing systems, marine policy, and marine resource management. Data from the CPR survey are made publicly accessible through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office. In addition, maintenance of a sample archive will maximize its use by the wider scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis project observes and describes long-term, pelagic plankton variability and diversity in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The data are enabling scientists to interpret marine biological change and assess anthropogenic, climatically forced, and natural plankton variability over multi-decadal time scales. Scientific research is anticipated to advance a number of key lines of scientific inquiry that will incorporate responses of the marine plankton community to large-scale environmental change, how changes can impact ecosystem productivity, and how connected these changes are across the wider Atlantic. In addition, CPR research focuses on biodiversity and invasive species; sustainable use of marine bio-resources; and ecosystem health, ocean acidification, and micro-plastics. These themes are highly relevant to timely and compelling scientific questions, marine policy and management interests of the United States, and  broad societal concerns regarding the marine environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award supports the major US-facing sampling effort of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey in the North Atlantic, the longest running and most extensive marine plankton survey in the world. The survey captures the microscopic floating plankton in the open ocean using silk mesh in sampling devices towed along standard routes, and the many species of plankton are identified and counted by the CPR analyst team-over 800 types are identified. The plant-like phytoplankton are responsible for the majority of all photosynthesis on earth, using sunlight to draw carbon dioxide out of the air and water. They provide food for tiny animals-zooplankton, which themselves support the vast food web of all the larger organisms in the ocean, from fish to whales. Additionally, carbon fixed by plankton may fall to the ocean floor as marine snow, so changes in the plankton community affect both the oceans productivity and carbon budget. Plankton and the ocean food web they support are vital to humans and also being affected by human activities, ocean warming and acidification. Because the sampling devices are mechanical and towed behind commercial shipping, the carbon emissions associated with CPR survey activities are minimised.\n\n\nSince 1931 the survey has covered over 7.2 million nautical miles (a Guinness World Record) and adds a further 10 thousand miles of tow each month: the long time-series of consistent measurements along each route enables us to identify changes and trends in the ocean due to man-made factors and climate change. NSF has maintained support for the CPR survey in the NW Atlantic (in particular the Z-route tows from Iceland to the US through major fisheries) continuously since 1990, and the survey database includes pre-1980s tow results for long-term comparisons.

These publications included a variety of collaborations with US researchers; in 2022 the survey collaborated with researchers at Woods Hole, the Bigelow lab for Ocean Sciences, NOAA Fisheries, U. of Maine, Ocean Visions, UGA, U. of Kansas, the Smithsonian, UCSD, UVA and others.\n\n\nResearch themes in 2022 included studying the connections between plankton and much larger marine animals in the North Atlantic such as Sand eels and Sunfish. The range occupied by these fish was found to change over time, tracking changes in ocean temperatures and plankton productivity.\n\n\nThe size of the CPR dataset and the variety of organisms recorded also allowed researchers to investigate basic ecological questions about how and why diverse communities of organisms form, and how each kind of organism finds and occupies a niche in the community that enables it to survive and preserves biodiversity as a whole. The variety of different traits exhibited by competing plankton organisms was found to enable each species to find an opportunity to thrive as conditions vary over time and space.\n\n\nThe ecosystem services provided by the plankton community (the important functions of the plankton to humans and other organisms) can be assessed and tracked through time using CPR data. In particular CPR data was used to quantify changes in the activity of plankton which sequester carbon in the North Atlantic and Arctic and move it to deeper water.\n\n\nThe open CPR data (those taxa consistently recorded since 1958), are made freely available under a CC-BY license via DASSH, the UK Node of the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), hosted at the MBA. In 2022 the CPR dataset was downloaded over 700 times from DASSH. Using global data exchange standards the CPR data are harvested by a number of larger marine biodiversity aggregators including EMODnet Biology, EurOBIS and the global OBIS database. CPR data is downloaded thousands of times a year from OBIS (more than 3700 times so far this year). In addition CPR data provide a key component of data products developed by ICES, OSPAR, and the European Open Science Cloud Blue-Cloud Pilot to support policy, management and decision making.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PeterHWiebe\n"
