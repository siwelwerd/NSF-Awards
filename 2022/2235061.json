 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a planning conference for Antarctic geodetic and geophysical observational networks and the associated research. The conference will be held in Fort Collins, Colorado, in late September 2022. The conference is expected to draw researchers from both the US and international research communities; this project will provide support to the participating US scientists. To broaden participation in the field, this project will focus on supporting early-career researchers and researchers who have not participated in fieldwork in Antarctica as of yet. A white paper will be produced following the conference, which summarizes the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe conference, entitled \u201cAn international workshop on the future of geodetic-geophysical observational networks in Antarctica\u201d, has five principal goals: 1) to review the current status of, and recent results from, the existing observational networks; 2) to identify the spatial and temporal shortcomings of the existing networks; 3) to construct ideas for leveraging logistics for future national and international projects; 4) to envision new directions to improve the reliability and duration of the networks; and 5) to form strategies to attract and promote a future generation of polar geoscientists with a focus on diversity. The conference is organized by members of a subcommittee of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. This linkage ensures that the conference meets international objectives, including improving the cooperation between observers and modelers and improving the cooperation between scientists making in-situ geodetic and geophysical measurements in Antarctica. The conference is coordinated with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Workshop, to be held in Estes Park, Colorado, 26 \u2013 29 September 2022, minimizing travel for some participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
