 "awd_abstract_narration": "Space weather refers to the dynamic changes in near-Earth space caused by complex Sun--Earth interactions. Space weather can pose hazards to electric power grids, telecommunications, spacecraft operations, and astronaut health. This project will advance our understanding of how the Earth\u2019s ionosphere\u2014thermosphere (IT) system changes due to the combined effects of solar variability and changes in the Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere, including extreme weather events such as tornadoes. Understanding IT system variability is an essential element to predict space weather. Extensive historical and ongoing observational data and state-of-the-art weather and geospace models will be used in the investigation.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be integral to the research efforts. The project will develop an online lecture series on space weather, organize virtual workshops for the public, and leverage existing REU, outreach and broadening participation efforts. The collaboration includes Clemson University, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\r\n\r\nThis project studies variations in Earth\u2019s ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system due to atmospheric waves from both terrestrial sources (including extreme weather) and geomagnetic disturbances triggered by solar activity. The key science questions are: 1) What is the day-to-day IT variability induced by lower-atmosphere waves and persistent geomagnetic disturbances? How do their relative contributions and underlying mechanisms change with locations? 2) What are the multi-scale IT responses to intense space weather and terrestrial convective events? How do their response characteristics compare? and 3) What are the preconditioning effects of atmospheric waves on the IT response to geomagnetic disturbances? A team of researchers active in the geospace CEDAR and GEM communities will investigate these questions. They will use data from a variety of ground-based and space-borne instruments, develop a high-resolution model coupling a general circulation model with a regional wave model, and utilize data assimilation to improve upon the model drivers. Broader impacts of the project include the potential to advance space weather forecasting by characterizing IT system variability. The project will develop a new space weather curriculum and leverage existing education and outreach programs at the collaborating institutions. ANSWERS projects will advance the nation\u2019s STEM expertise and societal resilience to space weather hazards by filling key knowledge gaps regarding the coupled Sun-Earth system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
