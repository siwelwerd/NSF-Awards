 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Boston University is acquiring X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy capabilities to support the research of Professor Xi Ling and colleagues Keith Brown, Malika Jeffries-EL, and Kevin Smith. The instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, engineering, and physics. XPS spectra are produced by irradiating a specimen with X-rays with sufficient energy to eject electrons, and the kinetic energy of the electrons is measured and subsequently related to their binding energy. These data can be related to the chemical elements in the sample as well as to their bonding environment. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. Students from diverse backgrounds utilize the instrument in their research and research training. Accessibility is enhanced through its integration in two courses.\r\n\r\nThe award for the XPS is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as functional materials and structures. This includes investigations of the electronic band structure of two dimensional materials and heterostructures as well as the optoelectric properties of organic semiconducting molecules relevant to solar technology. In addition, XPS is used to determine the electronic structure of low dimensional correlated solids to understand their optical, electrical, magnetic, structural, and chemical properties. It is also used to probe the surface chemistry and dynamics of nanostructured polymer surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
