 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2023, Broadening Participation of Groups under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan to increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The goals of this project are to investigate and catalog the leaf characteristics that native plants display in different climate zones across California and Hawaii. This dataset will provide evidence for whether plants with a certain leaf type are found in specific climate regions. This information is important because it will increase the understanding of the response of plants to changing environments. The project will increase representation in the field of plant evolution and promote teaching, mentoring, and collaborative research efforts with the University of California postdoctoral community.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a phylogenetic computational framework of analyses, using a multifaceted approach to consider trait ecology and evolution. Climate and trait variables will be mapped to detect phenotypic shifts across lineages. Current and future projected climate data for all geo-referenced herbarium specimens and for herbarium collections in species\u2019 native ranges, within and beyond California and Hawaii will be extracted from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This information will be used to determine associations of traits with climate across species ranges. Principle component analyses will be conducted to determine axes for climatic variation, followed by a phylogenetic ANOVA to examine trait evolution and the relationships of traits with environmental variables. This will test the lability of traits across environmental gradients and allow for the mapping of climate and trait variables to detect phenotypic shifts across lineages. In summary, the database will be a publicly available resource that fills a gap in knowledge concerning leaf traits and provides a foundation for future studies. This project will broaden the fellow\u2019s phylogenetic analysis skillset and develop the fellow\u2019s knowledge about flora-wide trait evolution. In addition to research the fellow will teach and support other underrepresented STEM trainees through mentorship at the University of California.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
