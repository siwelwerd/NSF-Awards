 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a portable system that can detect airborne virus particles such as COVID-19. The currently available airborne viral detection technique operates in a sequential manner by first collecting particles from air samples and then sending the sample for processing with an intensive and expensive liquid-reagent (reverse transcription polymerace chain reaction (RT-PCR)) testing. The potential customer profile encompasses individuals concerned with the air that they and their family members are breathing. This technology may also serve organizations concerned with their constituents\u2019 health in hospitals, public transportation (e.g., taxis, airliners, railways), schools, hotels, businesses, homeowner associations, and government agencies. The solution enables a timely identification of an infectious agent and minimizes the spread by isolating contaminated areas for swift localized sanitation, which helps prevent costly and aggressive over-sanitation and rapid depletion of personal protective equipment and resources.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of technology that can detect airborne COVID-19 and other viral particles in a small space. The proposed device seeks to directly provide guidance to the occupants of the room, enabling them to make informed decisions about safety. The detection of viral particles in air is critical to enabling intelligent decision-making about safe usage of the space. This technology integrates a COVID-reactive surface with a highly sensitive detection technology. In the presence of a virus particle, the spike protein on the surface of the virus interfaces with the active sensor, leading to a change in the resistivity of the device, which triggers a message on the device-screen and an alarm. To enable aerial interaction with the sensor element, an aerodynamic casing has been designed and developed. The flow profiles have been modeled using computational fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
