 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like most other areas of science, ornithology (the study of birds) lacks the diversity that is critical to a healthy, vibrant, and productive field of research. Much-needed efforts to broaden participation in the sciences have accelerated in recent years, particularly with respect to making science more welcoming and inclusive to individuals from groups that historically have been marginalized or excluded. Moreover, the popularity of recreational birding and the increasing number of volunteers participating in bird-themed citizen science projects has put ornithology in the spotlight with regard to calls for diversity and inclusion in the sciences. The joint 2022 conference of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) and BirdsCaribbean (BC) will be a powerful platform for activities to broaden participation in the field of ornithology. Being the first in-person meeting for either society in over two years, and being held in Puerto Rico, AOS & BC 2022 will be very well attended and will provide unusually strong training and outreach opportunities. By bringing together so many individuals with such diverse perspectives, the conference is certain to push ornithology in new directions.\r\n\r\nThis project will have direct impacts on diversity and inclusion within the discipline of ornithology. First, Diversity and Inclusion Travel Grants, and Caregiver Grants, will ensure a diverse pool of attendees. This diversity will be further enhanced by funds to support attendance by local Puerto Ricans. All of these attendees will participate in the broader scientific sessions, training workshops, and mentoring/networking events. Additionally, this project will support three workshops that will directly address broadening participation in ornithology. Together, these efforts at AOS & BC 2022 directly lead to a broader and more inclusive discipline, and will provide a solid basis for future efforts aimed at making ornithology and other STEM disciplines more diverse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
