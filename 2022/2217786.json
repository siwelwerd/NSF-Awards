 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information promises revolutionary advances in computation, communication, and sensing. By harnessing unique quantum mechanical properties, it is possible to attain exponential computational speedup, construct a quantum internet that sends information securely and anonymously, and enable sensors with precision that is orders of magnitude better than existing classical technologies. Although we have witnessed tremendous progress towards realizing such quantum technology goals in the past several years, we have yet to realize their full promise. This project is focused on realizing a scalable foundation for quantum photonic technologies. Photonics is a field based on manipulating and controlling the propagation of light, and photonic-based quantum technologies are one of the most promising for realizing mid-scale quantum technologies for sensing and quantum communication. This interjurisdictional effort between the University of New Mexico (UNM) and University of Delaware (UD) is focused on controlling the materials used to emit and absorb light, the location and wavelength of these light emission sites, and their integration into other photonic device components that can control how that light is distributed or manipulated. The project includes (1) developing student talent in a key area of national research need through the establishment of assistantships that will allow students to conduct research in this area and (2) the establishment of a quantum science and engineering graduate program at University of New Mexico (UNM) based on the new program recently established at the University of Delaware (UD).\r\n\r\nPhotonics based quantum technologies are one of the most promising branches, with the ability to realize devices on current CMOS and III-V type platforms. However, the research effort on this front is highly distributed, with some institutions focusing on the computational aspects, some on the fundamental material science problems, and others on the integration of devices to demonstrate photonic qubit systems. This project will establish an interjurisdictional effort between the University of New Mexico (UNM) and University of Delaware (UD) to realize a foundational program for scalable quantum photonics technologies. The intellectual foci of the effort include \u2013 (1) an integrated approach to overcoming the site- and spectral-inhomogeneity challenges that currently hamper the development of scalable quantum photonic material and device platforms; (2) coordinated efforts to develop and explore quantum emitters in both 2D and III-V materials, including first-principles calculations, materials synthesis, and quantum emitter characterization; (3) development of photonic device components including plasmonics, Kerr-microresonators for photon transduction, and superconducting single photon detectors; (4) leveraging the complementary expertise of UNM and UD to integrate photonic device components with quantum emitter materials. This integration will be used to demonstrate a) site-deterministic quantum emission into photonic device elements, b) capacity to tune or transduce single photon wavelengths to overcome spectral inhomogeneity, and c) all-on-chip deterministic generation, routing, and detection of single photons. Project plans include strong educational and work-force development programs, including the implementation of new graduate degree programs tailored to the skills required by the \u201cQuantum Workforce,\u201d that will train the next generation of leaders in quantum photonics technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
