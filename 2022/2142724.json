 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Combinatorial, Computational, and Applied Algebraic Geometry --Seattle 2022 (CCAAGS-22)\u201d will take place 27 June to 1 July 2022 at University of Washington Seattle. Algebraic Geometry is broadly interpreted to be the part of mathematics that studies systems of polynomial equations and inequalities. While Algebraic Geometry has often been considered a solely pure area of mathematics, the community of researchers of CCAAGS-22 promotes its applied and computational nature. Participants of CCAAGS-22 combine Algebraic Geometry with the techniques and methods from symbolic and numeric computation, algorithms, complexity theory, as well as problems motivated by applications in multiple fields. These methods have already seen applications in biology, coding theory, cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and statistics, among others. The interaction between algebraic geometry and any of these other disciplines is beneficial for both sides.\r\n\r\nThis conference brings together researchers and promotes interdisciplinary work in a fast growing area. After the lack of contact during the pandemic, this is a long overdue event. It is particularly useful for junior researchers whose careers strongly depend on making connections and networking. CCAAGS-22 is indeed planned with junior researchers and underrepresented groups as the primary audience we want to attract. For more details see https://sites.google.com/view/ccaaggs-22/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
