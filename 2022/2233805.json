 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the annual flagship conference of ACM SIGBio (Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics), the ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACMBCB) is aimed to provide an interactive forum that bridges computer science, mathematics, statistics, with biology and health. Its mission is to support\r\nadvanced research, training, and outreach. It brings together top researchers, practitioners, and students around the world to share innovative discovery, advanced development and delivery of informatics solutions to promote computational science, engineering for national health and biological advancement for societal impact. The ACMBCB2022 will be in Chicago IL during Aug. 7th-Sept. 01, 2023. This NSF grant will provide travel and registration support for up to 10 students (graduate, undergraduate, and high school) to attend the conference. The students will need to submit a short description about their on-going academic study and motivation for attending ACMBCB2022 (suggested to follow NSF Intellectual Merit, Broad Impact summary), plus supporting information such as a biosketch, a photo, and a letter of support from their advisor/mentor for selection. In addition, this NSF grant will broaden the diversity of participation from underrepresented groups (women, minority, and disabled) to enhance the community-building beyond the conference.\r\n\r\nThe 21st century is witnessing many transformations enabled by innovations happening at the interface of molecular biology, medicine, health, with statistics, computer science, data science, informatics, cloud computing, and AI. Thus, it is critical to cultivate the new culture when training younger generations. ACMBCB2022 will provide systematically organized activities such as workshops, tutorials, oral sessions, and poster sessions for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to interact, to discuss, and to collaborate.  NSF support will maximize both learning and research outcomes of students. Not only they will learn novel advancements in bioinformatics, computational biology, and health informatics from the conference and improve their knowledge, but also they will share their own research ideas in Student Forum to gain visibility and feedback. In addition, because underrepresented minority groups (women, minority, and students with disabilities) have relatively low participation, ACMBCB2022 will continually promote diversity in participation through both Student Forum and \u201cWomen in Bioinformatics\u201d organization. Senior researchers will be invited to provide feedback , and to share experience and wisdom in career development to continually build the community throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
