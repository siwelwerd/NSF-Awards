Humberto Gilmer is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM.  This fellowship to Dr. Gilmer supports his research project entitled \" MPS-Ascend: Superfluid Dark Matter: Unveiling the Dark Sector of the Cosmos\", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Brown University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Stephon Alexander.\r\n \r\nGilmer will explore a study a model of self-interacting dark matter which will provide an understanding of how dark matter mediates the gravitational interaction on galactic length scales, resolving the discrepancies present in the Standard Model of cosmology.  Gilmer will also work to increase the participation of historically excluded minority students in the Providence, RI area through the creation of an Arts in STEM program at Brown University.  This program will provide participants with knowledge of opportunities in STEM and a sense of science identity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
