 "awd_abstract_narration": "To further advance research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and combatting climate change, society requires the efficient use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. This project will lay out a plan to establish the STEllAR open-source organization that aims at making the use of HPC as accessible and efficient as possible. With the help of the community, STEllAR will develop a software ecosystem of users and developers by coordinating the development of tools and technologies targeting multiple science domains, delivering educational services and technical support for faster adoption of such technologies, and providing consultancy services to the community.\r\n \r\nThe CONSTEllATION project will develop a roadmap to establish the STEllAR non-profit open-source organization. The STEllAR organization will strategize and oversee the development of a secure, standardized, and industrial strength HPX (High Performance ParalleX, a standard C++ library for concurrency and parallelism) runtime to overcome the challenges that arise in the ExaScale era and beyond. STEllAR will also help the community to build the application program interface (API), infrastructure, tools, and ecosystem around HPX. In addition, the organization will provide (1) application assurance through building developer tools and documentation, technical support, continuous testing and integration, and standardization; (2) professional support including training, custom packaging, and technology architecture; and (3) community services such as education, workforce development, and outreach.  Rapid adoption of Asynchronous Many-Task runtime systems (AMTs) will help to increase the parallel efficiency and portability of modern high-performance applications and improve the energy efficiency of computing resources as society enters the ExaScale era. These capabilities will enable the scientific community to overcome the shortcomings of the commonly practiced Bulk Synchronization model and make way for developing a next generation of applications in AI, climate change, bio-informatics, and many other application domains of high societal impact. In addition, STEllAR will be a hub for outreach and education in the field of high-performance computing and related application areas.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\nhttps://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx\r\nhttps://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/latest/html/index.html\r\nhttps://stellar-group.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
