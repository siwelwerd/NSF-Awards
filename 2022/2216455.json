 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to develop a highly configurable radar system designed for integration on Unmanned Aerial Systems that can operate over a wide frequency spectrum. The potential remote sensing applications of these technologies are far-reaching, enabling transformative research in routine monitoring of ice sheets, sea ice, snow cover, soil moisture, crop health, and other areas. This project will target applications associated with ice sheets, sea ice, and snow cover. The broader impacts of this work include increasing scientific access to Unmanned Aerial Systems with sufficient range and payload capabilities to conduct geophysical surveys. The flexibility and small size of the radar system make its integration on a variety of medium unmanned aircraft possible, allowing our pursuit of other collaborative opportunities in the polar science community and beyond. Airborne ice-penetrating radar are a critical tool in collecting ice thickness and basal topography data. While several large-scale airborne surveys have been conducted over the last several decades, many regions of the major ice sheets of Greenland and more specifically Antarctica have not been surveyed due to their large extent and remote locations. Several recent high-profile papers continue to point to the importance of ice thickness data and its gradient at the grounding line for improving future sea-level rise predictions. The proposed system will address the continued call for polar ice and snow measurements.\r\n\r\nThe proposed radar will operate over sub-bands anywhere in the 10 MHz to 18 GHz spectrum and will be integrated onto the Vanilla Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) from Platform Aerospace, which recently set an endurance record exceeding eight days. The development of this sensor and its integration onto the Vanilla UAS has the potential to greatly expand airborne applications in environmental remote sensing through the superior range and endurance allowing routine measurements in remote locations. With this instrument, this project aims to: 1) address the remaining gaps in ice sheet thickness, especially across the Antarctic continent, 2) improve ice-discharge estimates, and 3) provide a means for routine monitoring of snow cover on sea ice. This effort also includes the development of custom aerodynamic pods that will house the radar antennas on the Vanilla UAS. This MRI project will train several graduate and undergraduate students by the incorporation of the design and development of the various subsystems into a wide range of engineering courses. These projects will equip students with the skillset needed by the STEM workforce while exposing engineering students to the environmental and societal issues driving the need for these new technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
