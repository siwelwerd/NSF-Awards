 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Ronald Quinlan from Christopher Newport University and colleagues Lisa Webb, Todd Gruber, and Christopher Meighan are acquiring a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometer, quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF LCMS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as agriculture and food chemistry, neurobiology, developmental biology, and biochemistry. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components are heated and flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized. The ions' masses are measured very accurately. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The various ionization sources provide added flexibility with regard to the types of samples that are analyzed. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. Particularly, the instrument would enhance research experiences for under-represented and first-generation college students. The instrument would be incorporated into four teaching laboratories impacting a significant number of individuals including those from under-represented groups. The instrument gives students experience using vital instrumentation that they carry with them into their careers.\r\n\r\nThe award of this mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies that include metabolomic analysis of bacteria-antibiotic interactions to improve antibiotics, metabolomic analysis of  plastic-degrading bacteria to allow pathway engineering to convert waste plastic to valuable compounds,  analysis of the effect on hormones of sub-lethal concentrations of nanoparticles in model organisms, quantitative profiling of membrane lipids to better understand cellular compartments, and many additional  applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
