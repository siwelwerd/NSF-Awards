This conference award supports participation of youth in activities focused on best practices for research partnerships, and sustainable development and climate adaptation strategies in Indigenous communities. Participants will have the opportunity to engage with UArctic leadership, Congressional representatives, and diplomats from Arctic nations.\r\n\r\nOrganized by the Wabanaki Youth in Science Program, the youth gathering engages Indigenous youth in learning, leadership, and collaborative activities related to sustainability science and the development of global partnerships. Participants will develop plans for a future youth sustainability conference and work on communication strategies to promote engagement. They will return to their home communities with international collaborative experience, a foundation in the principles of sustainability, and an expanded network of future Indigenous leaders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
