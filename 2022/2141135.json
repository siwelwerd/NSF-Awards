 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to measure viral concentrations in clinical or research settings.  Select vaccines and gene therapies are delivered via viral vectors, but the precise dosing is poorly known, leading to quality control concerns. Current measurement techniques are indirect, imprecise, and nonstandard; and they require time and specialized equipment. Accurate measurement of viral particles is critical for precise benchmarking of diagnostics and appropriate dosing of therapeutics. This project develops a new technology to measure viral concentrations and infectivity. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses viral quantification techniques as they suffer from several limitations. Typical infectivity assays are highly dependent on the specific cell line used for viral infection, leading to high variability between labs. Furthermore, natural viruses are not engineered to contain a fluorescent transgene for easy identification, and some particles will not contain the viral genome - leading to competition between those containing the gene \u201cpayload\u201d and empty vectors. In general, the density, infectivity, and replication efficiency of viral particles in a given sample is poorly known. This project advances a technology with three functioins: quantifying the total number of particles, measuring genome-containing units, and assessing infectivity of a given sample of the virus. The new method combines nano-pore technology using biophysical properties to identify viral particles with single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to discriminate down to single molecules of viral RNA in infected cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Viral vectors are often used for delivering genetic material (DNA or RNA) into cells for gene therapies, including CAR T-cell therapeutics, CRISPR therapeutics, and vector-based gene or vaccine delivery. However, a major challenge exists in measuring the virus count in a sample of harvested viruses, as well as the fraction of payload-containing viruses, which can be very low (&lt;0.1% in some cases). Our approach is to deliver through nanopore metrology a predetermined number of virions which enables measurements of their size distribution, count, and aggregation state, followed by assay performance to determine the number of genome-containing virions in the sample. Since viruses are often sticky due to their protein coat properties, we encountered many challenges: First, contrary to our original proposed scheme, the nanopore used for virion collection could not be used directly in cell media due to instantaneous clogging by particulates and debris from the media. To resolve this we adjusted the design such that translocated particles were dispensed into a channel filled with a non-interfering electrolyte buffer, which was then flowed out of the channel for collection in tubes. The collected samples were then used in downstream assays. Second, pore clogging leads to unpredictable dispensing rates, which we addressed by developing a surface functionalization strategy that employs an agnostic non-stick poly-electrolyte layer that is uniformly coating the pore surface. The poly-electrolyte layer also promotes electroosmotic flow which enhances virus transport through the pores. Third, we found that low transfection efficiencies of lentiviral preparations required us to transport much larger numbers of virions through the pores than we had originally planned for. To address this challenge, we designed paired devices that consist of individual pores and pore meshes that contain hundreds of pores. The individual pores quickly provide a physical titer (particle size distribution, concentration, and aggregation state), whereas the pore meshes allow us to prepare a predetermined number of virions across the membrane for further use. This device combination allowed us to scale up our assay to practical levels that permit infectious titer, which was a major outcome of this study.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In summary, this PFI-TT project provided a stepping stone towards robust quality control assays for gene therapies, which we anticipate will have a significant economic and health impact on society by improving the efficiency of vaccines and gene therapies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Meni&nbsp;Wanunu</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
