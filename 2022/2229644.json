 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use a combination of ocean observations and modeling to understand why the dissolved oxygen concentration in the ocean changes on timescales of years to decades. As oceans absorb heat, its oxygen content is expected to decline which will affect marine ecosystems and oxygen-sensitive biochemical reactions. In turn, biochemical processes can affect the oxygen level.  Understanding why oceanic oxygen changes remains limited due to sparse data and the fact that it naturally fluctuates. Furthermore, state-of-the-art Earth System Models, used to develop future projections, struggle to skillfully simulate present-day oxygen distributions. Given model biases, there is a clear need to re-calibrate model-based projections based on informed interpretations of available observations. The intellectual merit of this study is to perform a series of computational simulations to quantify linkages between the patterns of climate variability, ocean heating, and oxygen content for different regions. In conjunction with a novel synthesis of available observational data, this modeling study will develop a more comprehensive model for evaluating oxygen variability and change, thereby reducing uncertainty in future projections under climate forcing scenarios. Broader impacts of this study includes education and outreach about decreasing ocean concentrations in the ocean and its disruptive impacts on ocean biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystems. Two Ph.D. students and a postdoctoral scientist will be trained under the supervision of the PIs. \r\n\r\n\r\nOcean deoxygenation is a direct consequence of ocean heat uptake; as ocean waters warm, dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations decline, with profound influences on marine ecosystem and redox-sensitive biogeochemical cycling. Existing observations are characterized by significant interannual to decadal fluctuations. Natural variability challenges detection and attribution of human-driven trends; however, it can also be interrogated to provide mechanistic insight. State-of-the-art Earth System Models still struggle to skillfully simulate present-day O2 distributions but these models are useful because they invoke mechanistic representations of key processes. The objective of this project is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind interannual and decadal variability of O2 globally and regionally. Low- and high-latitude regions exhibit distinct patterns in dissolved oxygen and ocean heat content. In order to isolate the impact of physical and biological controls on O2 variability, a suite of numerical simulations will be conducted, including some with a global eddy-resolving configuration. Combining observational and model-based analyses will enable quantitative assessments about the relation between ocean heat uptake and deoxygenation, and linkages to climate variability and trends.",

Here are the key findings of this research:\n\nHistorical O2 variability in      the Pacific Ocean has been driven by distinct physical mechanisms in the      tropics and mid-latititudes.  In the      tropics, the O2 changes are well      predicted by density, implying a strong role for multi-year undulations in      the depth of water density layers, whereas in the mid-latitudes, the input      of O2 from the atmospheric via physical transport (ventilation) appears to      dominate the variability.\nThe fate of oxygenation in the tropical oceans is      strongly dependent on the isopycnal and diapycnal mixing in ocean models,      helping to explain the high degree of inter-model spread in future      projections of the tropical OMZ.  \n\n\nIn the North      Atlantic ocean, historical observations reveal pronounced interdecadal      fluctuations in oxygen content of the upper 700m.

Our results      highlight the key role of phytoplankton growth rates &ndash; and their      temperature sensitivity &ndash; in influencing the global response of ocean O2 inventories to climate change.\nWe find a striking difference in the projected      loss of species richness from warming and deoxygenation under two climate      scenarios.  The \u2018business-as-usual\u2019      scenario (RCP8.5) results in a major mass extinction rivalling those in      Earth\u2019s history, while the strong mitigation scenario (RCP2.6) largely      preserves biodiversity.\nWe find that      aggressive and immediate reduction of greenhouse gases can slow the rate      of O2 loss substantially, and this has      the effect of preserving habitat for marine species, and avoiding the      majority of the present risk of extinction.
