 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve lowering the barrier to adoption of renewable energy generation and energy storage. The project seeks to take advantage the sheer abundance and low costs of sodium materials compared to state-of-the-art lithium materials. This will reduce upfront energy storage cost and in turn the payback time and costs of electricity for end users can be significantly reduced. The United States has 23 billion tons of domestic sodium reserves, which makes up 88% of the global supply of sodium. Successful utilization of the vast U.S. sodium reserves in new battery technologies will significantly reduce import reliance of critical materials and alleviate supply chain limitations on lithium-based materials. This project will accelerate the adoption of solar and renewable energy generation, making the grid cleaner, more sustainable, and more resilient.\r\n\r\nThis research project advances new batteries enabled by a novel halide-based sodium solid state electrolyte. The technology offers several beneficial properties compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries: enhanced safety due to the use of completely nonflammable materials, higher volumetric energy density by using a dense alloy-based anode, lowered costs due to the abundance of sodium-based raw materials, and improved longevity from the use of superior halide-based solid-state electrolytes. Unlike the commonly used sulfide-based or oxide-based solid electrolyte materials, the halide-based innovation provides enhanced electrochemical and chemical stability while eliminating the need for high temperature sintering during fabrication. This project develops the halide solid electrolyte material, improving its baseline material ionic conductivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude, as well as exploring scalable synthesis routes using single-step fabrication at room temperature.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) that dominate the market today, Na ASSBs have improved safety (by using inorganic, non-flammable solid-state electrolytes), higher volumetric energy densities, lowered costs (by using abundant materials) and a long cycle life. This combination of attributes makes them ideal for the aforementioned applications. Our SBIR Phase I project focused on translating the Na ASSB from laboratory-scale formats to larger-scale formats to demonstrate scalability.</p>\n<p>The United States has 23 billion tons of sodium reserves, which makes up about 90% of the world&rsquo;s supply.

The main achievements are detailed as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Electrolyte Development</em></p>\n<p>One of the prior innovations for Na ASSBs is a halide-based solid electrolyte, Na<sub>x</sub>M<sub>y</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, where M is one or more transition metals. This class of materials are stable up to 3.8 V vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>, making them suitable with cathodes, as they are chemically and electrochemically stable and will not degrade. However, halides were previously made with a complex three-step process, had conductivity in the 10<sup>-5</sup> S/cm range, and are unstable with the anode. In this project, the synthesis process was simplified to a single step, which improves scalability, and new versions of the halide were discovered. Notably, the Gen 2 halide was found to have a conductivity in the 10<sup>-3</sup> S/cm range, and has even higher stability up to 4.0 V. As such, the Gen 2 halide now meets the requirements for higher-power stationary storage applications.</p>\n<p>As for the anode side, a new closo-borate-type solid electrolyte was developed. It has an ionic conductivity on the order of 10<sup>-3</sup> S/cm and can also be synthesized via single-step methods. Using the halide (on the cathode side), the closo-borate on the anode side, a Na ASSB was constructed with a sodium-tin alloy as the anode and a commercial Na cathode. Stable cycling was achieved; a capacity retention of over 80% was achieved after &gt;500 cycles. Stable solid electrolytes are thus crucial as they avoid unwanted interfacial reactions between the electrolyte and the respective electrodes, allowing for long-term operation.</p>\n<p><em>Electrode Scale-Up</em></p>\n<p>Our second innovation involves the Na alloy anode. A dense alloy anode, as opposed to conventional carbon, significantly increases the volumetric energy density of the battery and suppresses dendrite formation, a common cause of cell failure in Li or Na metal-based anodes. Additionally, the lower reactivities of sodium alloy-type anodes against electrolytes reduces safety hazards, making this class of high-energy anode materials promising for sodium batteries.</p>\n<p>One vital hurdle to overcome is the processability of the alloy-type anode. In other words, the anode should be fabricated using a procedure compatible with ambient environments and existing Li-ion production methods. To do so, an aqueous-based process (using water, a nontoxic solvent) to create a slurry cast (including binder and other additives) was developed (Image 1).</p>\n<p>Similarly, we applied the same strategy for the cathode, that is, using an aqueous-based water slurry to cast the cathode (Image 2).</p>\n<p><em>Electrolyte Scale-Up</em></p>\n<p>Solid electrolytes are usually unstable in ambient air and with most organic solvents, posing a considerable challenge in processability. To overcome this, a stable chemical environment must be created and maintained for the electrolyte throughout the solution process. Suitable solvents were screened and identified to avoid degradation of the solid electrolyte. This, in conjunction with particle size optimization, allowed us to produce highly conductive, thin, and flexible electrolyte films (Image 3).</p>\n<p><em>Cell Performance Benchmarking</em></p>\n<p>The three battery components (the alloy anode, the cathode, and electrolytes) as previously mentioned were integrated into a full cell. Our first successful prototype has achieved capacities exceeding 0.5 Ah, a capacity sufficient for commercially-relevant testing.</p>\n<p><em>Outlook</em></p>\n<p>While significant milestones were achieved during this project, challenges still remain. The sodium battery supply chain is still not mature, and thus materials (especially solid-state materials) are not yet manufactured at scale. This must occur for the materials to be cost-competitive, and collaborative efforts with industry partners on this front are ongoing. The same is true for sodium cathodes, which need to be manufactured at larger scales. Partnership efforts to secure this new supply chain along with further research are vital to bring this technology closer to fruition.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erik&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2136302/2136302_10784459_1695942562916_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2136302/2136302_10784459_1695942562916_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tin Electrode Cast\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2136302/2136302_10784459_1695942562916_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tin Electrode Cast\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Digital image of the tin anode cast on the aluminum current collector.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erik Wu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erik&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tin Electrode Cast</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2136302/2136302_10784459_1695942609403_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2136302/2136302_10784459_1695942609403_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cathode Cast\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2136302/2136302_10784459_1695942609403_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cathode Cast\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(Left) Digital image of the cathode slurry.
