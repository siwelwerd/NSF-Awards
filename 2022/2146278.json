 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cybersecurity is increasingly important to society, whether for national defense or for the protection of citizens as they take advantage of today's digital world to maintain their jobs, health and prosperity. Unfortunately, there are many actors ready to steal personal identities, illegally take intellectual property from U.S. companies, and even to make life difficult through interfering with energy supply chains or poisoning water resources. To ensure safety, steps are needed to make certain that there are enough superior cybersecurity experts in the government to guard against such growing threats. To maximize the impact of the cybersecurity workforce, these experts must also reflect the diversity of society including women, minorities, veterans, and those with disabilities. By way of this renewal, Marymount University will continue to recruit, educate, and place in government service, a diverse set of academically qualified individuals from a wide set of backgrounds, including community colleges. The grant will support their achievement of academic success and readiness for their placement in government service. They will be provided a full scholarship (tuition and some living expenses for the final 2 years of their program) as well as a first-class educational experience (earning a BS, MS, or DSc in Cybersecurity). The program will expand their knowledge, skills, and abilities in cybersecurity so that they can protect all of society as the use of technology continues to grow. \r\n\r\nThis project builds on the success and experience of the previously funded SFS project and will be guided by five objectives. First, is to continue to recruit a well-qualified, diverse group of students at all levels. Second is to ensure the highest levels of development of the students for government work. Third is to retain and graduate all students with a minimum GPA of 3.5 and facilitate 100% placement in government positions. Fourth is to develop professionals capable of designing, building, and managing secure information systems for the new connected world. Finally, it is to evaluate the extent to which enhanced student-faculty interactions, mentoring, community outreach, and joint involvement in research contributes to positive workplace outcomes, particularly for the members of groups historically underrepresented in their participation in the field of cybersecurity. Marymount has increased the effectiveness and sustainability of its programs by implementing an agile curriculum process to keep pace with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These curriculum changes are informed by workforce studies including a detailed understanding of the federal government needs, and by alliances with larger public institutions for research and resources. Marymount is an inclusive and representative institution that has successfully placed women, underrepresented minorities, veterans, students from community colleges, and the neurodiverse in government cybersecurity positions. The project will continue to produce an increasingly diverse pool of graduates, prepared to combat the security threats of today and tomorrow, but also responding to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the government. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
