 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor provides a transformative research experience for undergraduate (REU) program for students from around the country who otherwise may not have access to physics and astrophysics research opportunities. The first objective of the program is to prepare the students for a career in the physical sciences. The second objective is for the students to perform cutting edge research in modern physics laboratories with active research groups and dedicated faculty. The research areas include astrophysics and cosmology, atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, nonlinear dynamics, complex systems and nuclear physics. Professional development is a critical part of this REU program and students participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school, applying for grants, scientific writing and giving scientific presentations. A further programmatic initiative includes active recruitment and careful selection for gender balance and under-representative minority participants.  \r\n\r\nDuring the summer, ten students work closely with faculty mentors on a carefully crafted ten-week research project. The selected participants are interviewed to determine their general interests and are then matched to faculty who are active in research in that area. The project is defined based on the interest of the student and the research needs of the faculty. In addition to the research project the students are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of faculty research seminars. Students engage in additional educational and social activities, including safety training, machine shop and electronic shop classes, lab tours and a variety of lunches with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
