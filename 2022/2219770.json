 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over half of the school districts in Virginia provide computer science pathways through Career and Technical Education (CTE); however, many CTE teachers lack the content area expertise to teach higher-level technical courses. In addition, Virginia requires that licensed teachers attain a computer science (CS) endorsement by passing the CS Praxis exam or by completing several hours of computing-specific coursework from a regionally accredited college or university. This research-practitioner partnership between CodeVA, James Madison University, and three public school districts across the state addresses this need to effectively prepare Career and Technical Education teachers for the Praxis exam. The project will focus on CTE teachers who teach introductory-level CS in schools with large populations of underserved students (low income, rural, and students of color) and who need CS endorsement to be able to teach more rigorous and advanced CS courses. By defining personal learning goals, each teacher will receive training that resonates with the individual teacher\u2019s students, schools, and communities. The specific needs of their high school student populations will be further addressed as the teachers gain pedagogical skills that account for inclusion and cultural responsiveness. The project will relieve current teacher shortages in underserved school districts, thereby increasing the number of students engaging in high-quality CS coursework. The professional development resources developed in this project will be shared throughout the state and nationally, especially in those 22 states that also confer computer science endorsement through the CS Praxis exam.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research-practitioner partnership (RPP) are to design and implement new professional development, demonstrate that the professional development addresses the individual needs of teachers, show that teachers gain self-efficacy and identity related to teaching CS content to underserved students, and demonstrate professional development scalability. This will result in CTE teachers who are able to pass the CS Praxis exam and gain CS endorsement, who gain confidence in offering CS content in their classes, and who gain identity as CS teachers who plan to teach over the long term. The professional development program has two innovative elements: (1) personalized learning trails, defined as curricular sequences co-constructed by the RPP and teacher participants that align with participants\u2019 unique prior knowledge, background, and needs, preparing them to pass the Praxis; and (2) professional development content that extends beyond Praxis knowledge and skills to support rigorous CS teaching for intermediate and advanced student learning in schools with high student diversity. This project will contribute evidence in support of a personalized professional development approach to train teachers to not just teach advanced CS content but have confidence in their ability to develop lessons and identify as an advanced CS teacher. CS teacher self-efficacy, specifically teacher perceptions of preparation and readiness, is required for teachers to effectively implement the curriculum, and CS teacher identity provides the foundation for sustained motivation, job satisfaction, and commitment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
