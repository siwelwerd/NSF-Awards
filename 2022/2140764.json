 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language is used to perform various kinds of communicative acts - providing information, asking questions, making requests, etc. In any language, there are specific signals in the form of a sentence that indicates what communicative act it is typically used for. But these signals vary from language to language. This project examines how children learn to identify the communicative acts of the people speaking to them while learning the surface signals associated with these acts. Specifically, this project investigates how children come to associate interrogatives (\"Do you want a cookie?\") to questions. Mapping interrogatives to questions present interesting acquisition challenges. First, children need to figure out the form of interrogative clauses in their language: while all languages tend to have dedicated clauses for questions, the syntactic makeup of these interrogatives differ: in English, interrogatives usually differ from declaratives in word order (e.g. \"Do you want a cookie\" vs. \"I want a cookie\"), but not in Mandarin. To figure out the form of their language\u2019s interrogatives, children need to notice regularities in form. But how do children figure out which regularities matter, and how do they associate clause types with their canonical function? Second, children need to figure out when speakers are asking questions (vs. making assertions or requests). But how can they do so, if they can\u2019t yet rely on the forms typically used for these acts? Previous research shows that, despite the complexity of the task, children understand interrogatives and their conventionalized function as questions before age three. To investigate how children solve this complex mapping problem, this project examines how questions are asked in speech to children, using what forms, comparing English and Mandarin: how much formal regularity is there in how parents ask questions? And are there extralinguistic cues in speakers\u2019 behavior that can give away questionhood (e.g., pauses in conversation or focus of attention)? \r\n\r\nThe project tests the hypothesis that children learn to identify speech act (question) and clause type (interrogative) in tandem and mutually informative ways: children learn to identify interrogatives by tracking formal regularities in conjunction with their growing knowledge of questionhood and its associated social cues; similarly, they identify questions by tracking social cues in conjunction with their growing understanding of interrogative syntax. The project will consist of two corpus studies and one computational model: Study 1 examines conversations between English-speaking parent-child dyads and Study 2 conversations between Mandarin parent-child dyads, where parent utterances will be annotated for pragmatic, prosodic, and syntactic features. The annotated data will then be used to test the viability of this pragmatic syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis via computational modeling (Study 3).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Conventionally, interrogatives are used to solicit information, but the mapping between clause type and function is not inviolable.For example, polar questions like <em>Can you pass the salt? </em>may be used to issue a request. Additionally, parents of pre-linguisticinfants cannot expect their children to answer genuine information-seeking questions. Yet, previous research shows that childrenhave knowledge of interrogatives and their conventionalized function as questions before three years old. How do children acquire the association between interrogativity and questions? How prevalent are the misalignments in the input to children, and what consequences do such mismatches have for the acquisition of clause types and their functions? Further challenges arisewhen we consider languages beyond English. In languages like Mandarin, because of the lack of wh-movement, wh-interrogatives have the same syntax as regular declaratives. Moreover, some phrases characteristically associated with interrogatives also have non-interrogative uses. For example, wh-phrases can be interpreted as indefinites, and thus sentences containing wh-phrases can be either questions or assertions. However, despite the complexity of the task, our prior work suggests that three-year-olds know the two possible interpretations of wh-phrases, and like adults they are able to exploit both lexical andprosodic information to determine the correct clause type. How do Mandarin-speaking children figure out interrogative clauses? We hypothesize that children jointly learn the speech act and clause type categories from observations of pragmatic, prosodic,and syntactic features of utterances. On the one hand, children learn to identify questions by exploiting the prosody of theutterance and the pragmatic features of the utterance (such as the social function of the utterance and the social attentionalbehavior of the speaker); on the other hand, they learn to identify interrogatives by exploiting the syntactic features of thesentence. Crucially, however, learning to identify questions and learning to identify interrogatives are also mutually constrained: children could use speech act information to learn the makeup of interrogative clauses in their language, and use clause typeinformationto learn the pragmatics of questions. To test this hypothesis, a necessary first step is to establish a systematic, empirical picture on the information contained in theinput data that children receive. To this end, we conducted two studies: Study 1 examined speech to English-speaking childrenand Study 2 examined speech to Mandarin-speaking children. In both studies, we made use of data from existing corpora ofparent-child interactions and annotate each utterance for a theoretically motivated set of features, encompassing a sentence&rsquo;ssyntactic features as well as the corresponding utterance&rsquo;s prosodic and social pragmatic features. In addition to building anannotated dataset of the input, Study 3 provided a proof of concept for the pragmatic syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis for theacquisition of questions and interrogatives.This project benefits the scientific community by integrating insights from different subfields of linguistics (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and prosody), as well as tools from computational linguistics, to bear on questions of language acquisition. Additionally, by taking a cross-linguistic perspective, this project helps us understand the universal and language-specificproblems that children have to solve in learning interrogatives. Moreover, the datasets from this project are made availablepublicly through an Open Science Framework (OSF) repository and GitHub repository, which will be useful for the languageacquisition community as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence community beyond this project.Locally, the project had immediate educational benefits.
