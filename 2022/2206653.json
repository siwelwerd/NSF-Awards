 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\nNext generation electronic applications and devices will be faster with greater fidelity and require smaller device features with less heat dissipation. The tiny electron magnetic moment, called spin of which direction can represent information, has not been used in devices as much as its charge. These days, spin-based quantum information devices are being developed to achieve these objectives.  New forms of the well-known conducting polymer, namely (CH)n  (where n is a numerical index larger than ~20) that come in the form of microscopic bundled chains into fibers and rings, offers opportunities to provide long spin coherence that is required in such devices. In this project, the effect of light on (CH)n will be characterized using advanced optical and magneto-optical spectroscopies. This project will contribute to the development of new, enhanced components for electronics, i.e. integrated circuits, for numerous applications. In addition this project will also train undergraduate and graduate students and, thus, contribute to the future workforce of the US.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe understanding of paramagnetic, i.e. spin-carrying, electronic excitations in the novel chiral and cyclic forms of polyacetylene, (CH)n films could lead to new quantum sensing, spintronics and optoelectronic device concepts. In this project we will investigate the neutral photoexcitations in (CH)n which are composed of four entangled neutral spin 1/2 solitons having very long spin-coherence times and strong chiral effects.  For this research we will use a large arsenal of synthesis, electrical, magnetic, spintronics as well as transient and steady state optical and magneto-optical techniques to study spin lifetimes, spin diffusion phenomena, and optical properties of injected and photogenerated electronic excitations in chiral and cyclic (CH)x films and spintronic devices. In particular these investigations will be carried out using circularly polarized steady state and transient spectroscopies in a broad spectral range of 0.4-15 microns and time ranging from 100 fs to seconds. We will also use magneto-optics and various steady state and transient optically detected magnetic resonance techniques, as well as theoretical models to deepen our understanding of the novel neutral excitations in (CH)n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
