 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cascadia Subduction Zone in the Pacific Northwest is a region of great national interest and growing public awareness because of its high earthquake and tsunami hazard. The Cascadia margin has low levels of recorded seismicity, which reduces what is known of the properties of the earthquake zone. This project aims to identify variations in the structure and properties of the Cascadia margin to better understand the earthquake and tsunami risk to the Pacific Northwest. This project will work with other groups to build a new 3-dimensional picture for the margin. The project will support for four graduate students, two postdoctoral researchers, and three early-career scientists.\r\n\r\nFrom June 1 to July 11, 2021, a regional-scale multi-channel seismic study of the Cascadia Subduction Zone was collected using the state-of-the-art long-offset capabilities of the R/V Marcus G. Langseth as part of the CAscadia Seismic Imaging Experiment 2021 (CASIE21). During the expedition, 5,347 km of high quality 12-15 km streamer data were acquired in a 50-75 km spaced grid of seismic lines spanning the margin from the northern Gorda plate at 42\u00b0N to the end of subduction offshore Vancouver Island and from ~50 km seaward of the deformation front to near the coastline. This new survey represents the first regional-scale study conducted at Cascadia, spanning most of the subduction zone and filling important gaps in data coverage. This project utilizes the CASIE21 dataset in order to study nearly the whole Cascadia margin and will yield unique insights into three core questions: (1) What is the geometry of the plate interface along the margin, where is significant sediment subduction occurring, and how do plate interface properties including reflectivity and roughness vary along the margin and down dip? How do plate interface properties relate to incoming plate and upper plate structure and megathrust rupture segmentation? (2) How do the structural style and evolution of the upper plate vary along strike and how are they related to megathrust strength, backstops, and fluid migration? (3) How does the lithostratigraphic architecture of the sediment section, and structure, deformation and hydration potential of the shallow-most oceanic crust of the incoming plate associated with bend faulting, distribution of seamounts and propagator shear zones vary along the margin and how do these properties contribute to wedge evolution and megathrust rupture segmentation? This study will result in construction of a new regional-scale structural interpretation of the offshore Cascadia region from seismic images as a primary product along with select studies making use of reflectivity, velocity models, and strain analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
