 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational complexity theory studies the power and limitation of efficient computation: What can be computed efficiently with bounded resources such as time, memory, randomness, communication, or quantum bits? This project focuses on the differences between the computational power of deterministic, randomized, and quantum computation: Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic algorithms? Are quantum algorithms more powerful than randomized algorithms? Recent experiments have demonstrated \"quantum advantage:\" the ability to perform tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Nonetheless, without rigorous proof, the validity of these beliefs might be fragile. The project seeks to establish provable gaps between the power of quantum and classical computers, and to understand for which computational tasks these gaps exist. Towards understanding the role of randomness in computation, the project aims to show that randomness does not save space, i.e., that any space-efficient randomized algorithm can be derandomized at almost no cost in terms of space. The educational plan includes the development of courses at UC Berkeley and a program at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing -- both aimed to make the field of study more accessible and inclusive.\r\n\r\nThis project approaches these two fundamental questions through the Fourier analytical lens. Indeed, discrete Fourier analysis is a powerful tool revealing deep insights on problems arising in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. A broad phenomenon named \"Fourier Growth\" sheds light on these two questions. For one, Fourier Growth explains the advantage of quantum over classical algorithms in the black-box setting. For another, Fourier Growth captures structural properties of small-space computation that are then exploited in the design of pseudo-random generators. In a nutshell, Fourier Growth captures the algorithm's ability (or inability) to aggregate many weak signals from the data. The project seeks to study the full extent of this phenomenon and its potential applications to tackle long-standing open questions in circuit complexity, pseudo-randomness, and communication complexity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
