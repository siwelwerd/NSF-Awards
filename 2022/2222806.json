 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robotic-assisted surgical devices (RASD) enable surgeons to use computer and software technology for advanced visualization and control of surgical instruments for a variety of procedures, decreasing the invasiveness of the procedure compared to traditional surgery. However, the successful adoption of this innovative technology into surgical environments requires consideration of worker training, workflow, and other potential barriers to acceptance. This work establishes a foundation for the future integration of surgical robotic technology into human-robot teams.\r\n\r\nThis project development proposal involves a multidisciplinary team who aims to 1) understand attitudes, barriers, and facilitators of current human-robot work systems; 2) integrate expert perspectives on challenges and opportunities for enhancing the adoption of RASDs; and 3) validate a training model based on statistical learning; and 4) create a framework for future development of RASD integrated work systems. Understanding attitude and needs of all workers in a surgical setting is critical for implementing and evaluating human-robot collaborative teams to improve surgical safety and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, the successful adoption of this innovative technology into surgical environments requires consideration of worker training, workflow, and other potential barriers to acceptance. This research identified and addressed key adoption barriers through the lenses of human-robot interaction, the built environment, and training. A multi-phase approach was taken including systematic reviews, surveys and focus groups of workers and subject matter experts (clinicians, engineers, architects, etc.), and a workshop with these subject matter experts was completed. Overall, the study identified gaps and proposed guidelines to enhance RAS system development and adoption. These include improving ergonomics for clinicians, integrating automation incrementally to build trust, optimizing operating room layouts with adequate storage for better workflow, and designing RAS systems suitable for both existing space-constrained operating rooms and for future operating rooms. In addition, a framework to understand the changing dynamics and skill requirements of surgical teams as they adapt to surgical robotic systems was created. The framework highlights the importance of technical and nontechnical competencies, emphasizing the roles of both individual team members (e.g., surgeons and surgical staff) and their interactions with RAS systems and the hospital environment. This approach highlights the complexity of RAS, where success depends on seamless coordination and effective training of all team members. Metrics and measures for these interactions are summarized for future researchers and device manufacturers to reference. The broader impacts of this work include contributing to potential improvements in the safety and efficiency of RAS. By examining diverse perspectives among surgical team members and uncovering socio-economic differences in the general population&rsquo;s perceptions of RAS, this work provides a foundation for equitable adoption of current and future robotic systems. Ultimately, this research supports healthcare providers, enhances patient outcomes, and advances the integration of robotics into surgical care.</h3><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/18/2024<br>\nModified by: Jackie&nbsp;Cha</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
