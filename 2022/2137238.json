 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship will support investigations into atmospheric chlorine chemistry in the Arctic and the resulting potential for the creation of secondary organic aerosol. Arctic tropospheric chemistry is of particular importance for study because the Arctic is warming more rapidly than anywhere else on Earth, causing a loss of sea ice and the introduction of more anthropogenic emissions into the Arctic air through shipping and petroleum extraction. Additionally, because of the pristine nature of Arctic air in which cloud formation can be limited by the number of cloud condensation nuclei, the production of secondary organic aerosol may alter cloud cover and radiation balance in the Arctic. The results of this work will have implications for understanding the effects of the changing climate on Arctic atmospheric composition and will build insight into the chemistry of other wintertime and marine environments where tropospheric halogen chemistry is important.\r\n\r\nThis research is directed toward better understanding the Cl-initiated oxidation of volatile organic compounds in the Arctic and the production of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) and their contribution to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production. The following questions will be investigated: (1) What are the products and SOA yields of Cl-initiated VOC oxidation at low temperatures? And (2) How much do OVOCs from Cl-initiated oxidation of VOCs contribute to the total aerosol production in the Arctic?  A combination of laboratory and modeling experiments will be used to address these questions. A series of low-temperature flow tube experiments of VOC oxidation by chlorine atoms will be conducted followed by the development of an updated halogen mechanism in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to include the low-temperature SOA yields determined in the laboratory experiments. This will be followed by a series of modeling experiments to quantify the contribution of Cl-initiated VOC oxidation to SOA formation globally, with a focus on the relative importance of various aerosol formation pathways in the Arctic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis work focuses on a new approach to laboratory chamber studies of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production that leverages multi-scale modeling to design atmospherically relevant chemical environments. SOA is a significant, and sometimes dominant, portion of the global aerosol burden and has impacts on both human health and on the earths radiative balance. Despite decades of research on SOA formation, current large-scale models are unable to reproduce the variability in atmospheric organic aerosol. Because descriptions of SOA formation in regional and global models of the atmosphere are based on laboratory experiments, the limitations of our laboratory experiments become the limitations of our models. Hence, mimicking atmospheric chemical conditions in the laboratory is vitally important for ensuring accurate model predictions of air quality and climate.\n\n\nHere, we developed a new experimental approach that leverages both global modeling and detailed mechanisms to design chamber SOA experiments that capture atmospheric chemical environments for two key branching points in VOC oxidation: atmospheric oxidant balances and atmospheric RO2 chemistry. Using isoprene as a model system for multi-generation SOA production, we focused first on competition between oxidation by OH and Cl. Global modeling indicates that multi-oxidant, multi-generation oxidation outcompetes single-oxidant, multi-generation oxidation in this system; we designed and performed a series of chamber experiments to measure multi-phase product distributions from multi-oxidant, multi-generation isoprene oxidation. Second, we developed a framework for quantitatively describing atmospheric RO2 chemistry and showed that no previous experimental approaches to studying SOA formation have accessed the relevant atmospheric RO2 chemistry. Leveraging multi-scale modeling, we designed and performed a series of chamber experiments to measure isoprene SOA production under a range of atmospheric RO2 fate distributions.\n\n\nWe anticipate this new approach will serve as a template for future experiments of atmospheric VOC oxidation. Ultimately, progress in atmospheric chemistry requires connections between laboratory experiments, field observations, and modeling; the work supported by this fellowship demonstrates how model-measurement integration can be used to advance the study of atmospheric SOA production.\n\n\nWe have presented this work at a variety of conferences (American Chemical Society, American Association for Aerosol Research, American Geophysical Union, European Geophysical Union). The part of this work focused on RO2 fate in under review at Science Advances (preprint available on Chem Rxiv: https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/65cacaa266c1381729813b06).
