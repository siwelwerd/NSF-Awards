 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Nonlocal School on Fractional Equations (NSFE) 2022, held on campus of Iowa State University on June 9 \u2013 11, 2022. Fractional (nonlocal) models in science and engineering can account for long range interactions and are notably flexible in being applicable to non-smooth scenarios. Motivated by these facts and several applications, this research area has attracted a significant amount of recent attention on both theoretical and computational fronts. Examples include novel fractional-derivative-based models in imaging, geophysics, plasmas, deep neural networks, minimal surfaces, and phase transitions. These emerging applications have created a need for development of a modern theory, new numerical methods, and subsequent control of the nonlocal fractional models. The NSFE 2022 meeting aims to address most of these topics. A primary goal of the school is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in nonlocal equations, as well as to provide a vibrant networking environment. There will be two (three hour long) mini-tutorial style lectures and six invited talks from leading researchers in the field. \r\n\r\nThis meeting will advance knowledge in nonlocal modeling, optimal control, numerical analysis, implementation, and software development. These topics involve numerous aspects of probability theory, optimization and variational analysis, convex analysis, and applied and computational mathematics. The school aims to stimulate new developments in these important areas of mathematics and their application to finance, physics, biology, data science, and engineering. The meeting also aims to provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other early career scientists to interact with leading researchers in fractional nonlocal models. The organizers are making a special effort to recruit participants from minority groups in STEM and from minority serving institutions. Videos of the lectures as well as lecture notes will be uploaded on the conference website: https://pabloraulstinga.github.io/NSFE2022.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
