 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC/R) industry is projected to see an increase in value from $26.5 billion in 2019 to $35.8 billion in 2030. It is projected that over the 10-year period from 2016-2026, HVAC/R jobs nationally will grow 15%. This project will design an accelerated HVAC/R apprenticeship program to support the HVAC/R industry in Northeast Ohio. The program will be responsive to input from regional industry partners regarding the design and implementation of the apprenticeship. It is expected that the competency-based apprenticeship model will allow apprentices to complete the program in three years rather than the five years for a traditional, time-based apprenticeship as apprentices will be assessed for competencies rather than tracked for completion of hours. The apprenticeship will provide a guided pathway that pays participants while they learn and offers apprentices the opportunity to earn a Journeyman credential upon successful completion of the program.\r\n\r\nThe project team will develop a state-approved, accelerated, competency-based, HVAC/R apprenticeship program to help meet employment demand in the HVAC/R industry and provide students the field experience necessary to quickly move from an entry-level technician role to a Journeyman-certified HVAC/R position.  Project objectives include: 1) establish a state-approved, competency-based HVAC/R registered apprenticeship program at Stark State College; 2) enroll students into the apprenticeship with a focus on veteran students and high school students/recent graduates; 3) retain at least 80% of students/apprentices enrolled in the program; 4) prepare students for HVAC/R Journeyman certification upon completion of the accelerated apprenticeship; and 5) evaluate project outcomes and widely share best practices for replication purposes. By working with regional HVAC/R industry partners, local public school districts, community veterans agencies, and area workforce development agencies, the project will recruit apprentices into a career pathway leading to well-paying, high-demand occupations in the HVAC/R sector. The model of a competency-based apprenticeship may be adapted for other industry areas. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
