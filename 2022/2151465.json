 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability and a significant contributor to reduced work productivity and wage loss. Intelligent, adaptive trunk exoskeletons are a novel class of wearable robotic systems that reduce or redistribute the load on the spine and trunk muscles, thereby offering a nonsurgical and nonpharmaceutical LBP intervention that may be more effective that standard spinal orthoses because intelligent exoskeletons will have the capability to adapt their mechanical support to the changing activities and needs of the wearer. The research objective of this project is to characterize the bidirectional adaptations that will promote useful and comfortable interactions between an intelligent trunk exoskeleton and its wearer. The project offers three \"work packages\", which will develop fundamental knowledge about the effects a trunk exoskeleton has on human movement and physiology in a variety of activities performed in and out of the research lab. The project will also increase knowledge about how intelligent exoskeletons can adapt themselves to the wearer in an activity-specific manner, and how the wearer's exoskeleton usage patterns evolve over time. The project will promote the nation's health and prosperity by advancing the effective design and deployment of trunk exoskeletons, which will have broad impact on human health and productivity. For example, intelligent trunk exoskeletons could help workers in occupations like agriculture and materials handling to lift heavier loads with lower risk of injury. Broader impacts of the project include the integration of project technology and results into undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as outreach to K-12 and community college students, individuals with low back pain, and to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe project's Intellectual Merit is advanced through three sets of human subject experiments organized into \"work packages\". The first determines the effects of the exoskeleton's compression and stiffness on various aspects of the wearer's trunk biomechanics, metabolic load, task completion strategy, and perceived comfort during low-intensity, high-intensity, and unpredictable laboratory-based activities. The results will provide insight into how exoskeleton compression and stiffness can be adjusted to enhance task performance and comfort. The second work package integrates sensors and actuators into the exoskeleton, thereby allowing an intelligent algorithm to infer the wearer's posture and intended task, and to reconfigure the exoskeleton's fit in a task-appropriate manner. Additionally, a smartphone app will let users manually adjust the exoskeleton's configuration using a simple user interface. The automatic and manual approaches will be compared in lab-based experiments involving participants with and without LBP. The third work package performs a 2-week, home-based, unsupervised evaluation of the adaptive trunk exoskeleton to examine how the user?s relationship with the exoskeleton evolves over time, such as whether users develop new usage strategies as they gain experience with the device. Supervised laboratory evaluations will be performed before, during, and after the 2-week evaluation period to determine how extended experience with the exoskeleton affects its effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They can optionally also use motors to augment lifting motions. Such technologies could be highly beneficial for both people with back injuries (to prevent further injury) and for workers in physically demanding jobs (to reduce risk of injury and chronic pain). However, at the start of the project, it was still unclear how such exoskeletons should be designed, how users would interact with them, and what their actual benefits would be. Our team this focused on three <strong>research directions</strong>:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Influence of the exoskeleton&rsquo;s mechanical characteristics in different tasks</strong>: In several studies with human subjects, we demonstrated that a trunk exoskeleton&rsquo;s effects vary significantly between activities. For example, an exoskeleton that reduces back load during lifting tasks may unintentionally impede users during other tasks, thus giving the user a worse impression of the exoskeleton as a whole. These effects also depend on the exoskeleton&rsquo;s mechanical characteristics: for example, a stiffer elastic element may provide more assistance but also more unintentional inconvenience. An incorrectly placed elastic element may even push the wearer to make unhealthy motions in order to avoid momentary discomfort, thus resulting in long-term detrimental effects despite short-term benefits.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Using wearable sensors to recognize the wearer&rsquo;s activities</strong>: We combined wearable sensors like inertial measurement units (which measure body accelerations and velocities) and electromyography sensors (which measure muscle activation) with modern machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize the activity the wearer is performing. For example, during lifting activities, we were able to detect whether the user was lifting in an ergonomic way (e.g., with their legs) or an unhealthy way (e.g., with their back) as well as the direction of the lift.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Exoskeleton benefits for workers</strong>: We conducted a study where both construction workers and people with no construction experiences used a trunk exoskeleton to perform approximations of construction tasks (e.g., carrying lumber boards, maintaining a hunched-over pose with a power tool). The study showed that both experienced construction workers and novices exhibited reduced back muscle load due to the exoskeleton, suggesting that the device may be beneficial in actual work settings and that findings from novices may to some degree generalize to actual workers. Toward the end of the project, we carried out pilot measurements on an actual construction site, and we will expand this work in the future.</p>\n<p>In addition, our team carried out diverse studies in biomechanics (for example, on the mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletes) and contributed to review papers on wearable robotics and biomechanics. Overall, the work conducted in this project contributed to 18 peer-reviewed journal articles and 5 conference papers.</p>\n<p>The project has had a <strong>significant impact</strong> on the field of trunk exoskeletons, as other researchers have adapted aspects of our research methodology, and several commercial trunk exoskeleton devices have been directly influenced by our work. Much of the work is also generalizable to other wearable technologies. For example, the wearable-sensor-based activity recognition algorithms can be adapted to technologies such as robotic prostheses, and findings about the influence of different mechanical characteristics may generalize to other exoskeleton types as well. In the long term, we expect that our work will encourage the broader adoption of trunk exoskeletons in physically demanding jobs, reducing the incidence of back injuries and back pain. As low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, our project may thus help improve health and quality of life for millions of people. Additionally, our work may encourage adoption of trunk exoskeletons to support assistance and rehabilitation after back injuries, which may contribute to pain relief, better stability and better functional ability for millions of people suffering from disabilities that affect posture.</p>\n<p>Finally, the project included several <strong>education and outreach </strong>activities. The hardware purchased for the project was used to perform lab sessions in both undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of Cincinnati and University of Wyoming. Lectures about the project were given in multiple courses at both institutions, and the Principal Investigators gave in-person and virtual presentations about the project to elementary school, high school and community college students from various Wyoming and Ohio schools. Finally, the project provided one-on-one training to several graduate students; notably, one senior graduate student obtained a tenure-track faculty position in 2024, and other former graduate students have become postdoctoral fellows or productive researchers in industry. The project has thus been highly productive with regard to scientific impact, potential broader impact, and education and outreach.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/06/2024<br>\nModified by: Vesna&nbsp;D&nbsp;Novak</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151465/2151465_10636091_1715049616962_Figure_ExoBoards--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151465/2151465_10636091_1715049616962_Figure_ExoBoards--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A person uses a trunk exoskeleton to raise boards.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151465/2151465_10636091_1715049616962_Figure_ExoBoards--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A person uses a trunk exoskeleton to raise boards.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A person wearing a trunk exoskeleton raises lumber boards from the ground, an approximation of construction-relevant activities.
