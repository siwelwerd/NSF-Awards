Speakers and poster presenters will share a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art topics to cover genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of formation, structure and function of biomineralized tissues. Interactions of biominerals with the environment, impact on health and disease, as well as the translational aspect of biomineralization in tissue engineering will also be covered. The accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will emphasize creating new connections between students, postdoctoral fellows and early-career and experienced researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
