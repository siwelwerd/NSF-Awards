 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will establish a Space Weather Roundtable, supported by NSF, NASA, and NOAA, as mandated in the 2020 Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow Act. A standing committee, the Space Weather Roundtable will include approximately 15 experts in the physical sciences, engineering, social sciences and economics, emergency management, and federal, state, or local policy-making. In addition, each of the sponsors\u2014NOAA, NASA, and NSF\u2014will designate an agency representative as an ex-officio member. They will discuss issues of mutual concern related to space weather research, operations, policy, and societal resilience. The Roundtable will facilitate advances in space weather modeling and forecasting; increase coordination of space weather research-to-operations and operations-to-research; and improve our Nation\u2019s preparedness for space weather events. This effort will be transformative, as space weather has the potential to affect hundreds of millions of people in the United States and billions across the world due to its impacts on critical Infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
