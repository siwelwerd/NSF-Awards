 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a group of 15 US-based doctoral students, early and mid-career professionals to virtually attend the Doctoral Consortium, Early Career Workshop, and Mid-Career Workshop at the Annual Meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences to be held virtually in June 2022. This workshop will enhance the capacity of the learning sciences as a field to address important challenges associated with the transformation of education and broadening of participation in the digital age. Additionally, the workshop will target diverse participants within the field and mentor scholars who are underrepresented. The overall goal is to support new scholars in the interdisciplinary learning science research community and contribute to impactful research on learning that will benefit society as a whole.\r\n\r\nGiven the virtual setting due to the continuing Covid-19 pandemic, the project will employ new technologies to create virtual-based opportunities for community building and networking for the participants. The workshop organization builds on a successful model documented as effective in similar past workshops, providing opportunities for the participants to interact with international researchers and practitioners. The activities provide participants with a deeper understanding of the field combined with hands-on mentorship. This will support early career scholars to succeed in the field and go on to make valuable intellectual contributions. Ultimately, the workshop will enhance the capacity of the learning sciences as an interdisciplinary field to address important challenges associated with the transformation of education and broadening of participation in the digital age.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
