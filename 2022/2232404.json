The hope is thatthe human centered active approach, and the early consideration of ethical and social requirements, will have a significant payoff in promoting human well-being.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will address four areas: 1.) Knowledge Representation: The development of methodology(ies)for the acquisition, validation, and representation of ethical information in a way that can be incorporated into system design; 2.) Design Guidelines: Strategies that incorporate human centered design principles into the design of User Interfaces (UIs); 3.) Metrics: The definition of evaluation metrics to test the success and limitations of prototype AI solutions in some selected domains; 4.) Regulation and Compliance: Crafting regulations to be more easily incorporated during design to improve and ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
