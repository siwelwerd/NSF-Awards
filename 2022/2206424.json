 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research team from the New Jersey Institute of Technology advance our understanding of how the solar corona is heated.  Many mechanisms for energy release in the solar corona have been proposed. This project would examine both thermal and magnetic properties of solar active regions and their connection to the solar corona. The project will be carried out using observations from the Extended Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) combined with 3D numerical simulations. This project meets NSF\u2019s mission to advance science by tackling a fundamental problem in solar physics. It also contributes to understanding of the solar environment, which contributes to the national priority to better understand space weather. The project includes participation by high school and graduate students and makes use of the GX Simulator, which has already proved successful in engaging students in research. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will address the coupling of thermal and magnetic structures from active regions (ARs) to the corona. This will be achieved by modeling coronal magnetic fields and plasma properties, which will then be compared with observations. The 3D structure of the coronal magnetic field will be quantified. AR evolution will be examined by combining maps of the coronal magnetic field with thermal plasma and validating these maps with data from EOVSA and space-based sources. These 3D maps will then be used to constrain scaling laws, which will be investigated for constraints on the coronal heating mechanisms. Finally, this will be used to examine how magnetic field energy accumulated and evolves. The codes employed include the Automated Model Production Pipeline (AMPP) for generating 3D models of ARs, a stand-alone Non-Linear Force Free Field (NLFFF) code, and the above mentioned GX Simulator.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
