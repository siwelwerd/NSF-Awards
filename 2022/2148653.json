 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma is the most abundant form of matter in the observable universe.  Plasma Science and Engineering (PSE) translates advances in fundamental plasma science to technologies that address society\u2019s needs.  This Future Technologies and Enabling Plasma Processes (FTPP) project will develop future transformational technologies enabled by PSE, including the design of novel materials, agricultural applications, sterilization, food safety, and space weather forecasting. The proposed foundational plasma research will incorporate the complexity of particle kinetics and energy flow into theory, models, and experiment.  This will lead to better understanding, diagnosis, modeling, and control of these processes in pursuit of transformational technologies.  The project integrates components of experimental and theoretical plasma research to create a diverse and skilled workforce to strengthen PSE capacity in the state.  FTPP will be administered by the University of Alabama in Huntsville in collaboration with nine other institutions: Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Alabama State University, Auburn University, Oakwood University, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, and University of South Alabama. The Computational Fluid Dynamics Research Corporation will partner with the project to advance plasma technologies for materials processing, aerospace, electronics, and energy applications.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the Future Technologies and Enabling Plasma Processes (FTPP) project is to: 1) develop transformative technologies in hard and soft (or bio-) materials, food safety and sterilization, and space-weather prediction; and 2) build capacity in Plasma Science and Engineering (PSE) research and its supporting workforce, making Alabama a world-renowned hub for PSE.  Foundational plasma research will incorporate the complexity of particle kinetics and energy flow into theory, models, and experiment to understand: 1) energy transfer from electromagnetic fields to plasma species mediated by collisions and collective processes (e.g., turbulence, self-organization); and 2) the transfer of energy and momentum from large-scale flows and magnetic fields to the creation of highly energetic particles in laboratory, ionospheric, magnetospheric, solar, and heliospheric environments.  These foundational research activities in PSE will enable future transformational technologies including: 1) data-driven approaches in plasma-synthesized, high-entropy, and quantum materials (addressing two of NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas, \u201cHarnessing the Data Revolution\u201d and \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d); 2) plasma-processed polymer composites from waste materials; 3) surface-modified biomaterials with antimicrobial properties and plasma-treated seeds with increased yield potential; 4) food safety and sterilization; and 5) space-weather fore/nowcasting to predict the geospace radiation environment and protect space-based technologies.  The requested resources and activities of the project will establish and strengthen collaborations among academic institutions and industries, thereby enhancing the research and education capacity for the advancement of low-temperature-plasma science and technology across the state. The core research program is well integrated with education, workforce development, and diversity plans that span academic, public, and private sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
