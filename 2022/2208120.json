 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve health care outcomes associated with complex procedures.  Approximately 1 in 7 major surgical procedures in the US is associated with a medical complication, totaling more than 4 million complications and $80 billion in costs per year. Many more complications occur in non-surgical settings. This project will use machine learning to combine proven engineering principles with clinical expertise to identify and address specific risks for each procedure, care facility, and patient (accounting for high-impact risk factors ranging from diabetes to social determinants of health). This technology will augment existing standardized, outcome-oriented quality-improvement tools with cost-effective customized, process-oriented tools in a novel way, with an envisioned initial application for the ~5,100 community hospitals in the US.  A modest improvement of 1% of complications would annually reduce costs by nearly $1 billion and will save 4,500+ lives.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a systems-based approach to examine process-level risk in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is inconsistently structured and not optimized to directly improve patient outcomes. The large datasets for most procedures provide only high-level conclusions regarding risk; they do not pinpoint the specific steps in provider workflow with high risk or the role of external factors, such as comorbidities or facility age. This project will determine the feasibility of using machine learning supervised by experienced clinicians to assess risk using principles from Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. The project will develop a proof-of-concept machine-learning system that uses a proprietary risk taxonomy and modifiers to combine national, state, facility, and actuarial datasets to generate risk priority numbers for each step for a service line. This system will then be applied to coronary artery bypass graft surgery to assess its validity and clinical value. Monte Carlo simulations and clinician focus groups using a Likert scale will determine the significance of the results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Some 1 in 4 hospitalizations in the US involves a patient safety-related adverse event, totaling over 58 million incidents annually. Those incidents result in nearly 250,000 deaths and incur costs of nearly $170 billion. To address this problem, we created a system that identifies the specific steps with the most risk for each procedure, each patient, and each facility. Our premise is that patient risk cannot be assessed using only patient risk factors&mdash;they must be combined with an understanding of the patient experience at the point of care, which reveals risks created by human factors, workflow, system conditions, and social determinants of health (SDH). As a result, our innovation accounts for all factors relevant to patient risk, from diabetes to provider fatigue to SDH. Our technology will optimize the outcomes for patients by focusing the attention of healthcare providers at the point of care on the most important steps for each patient, thereby minimizing distractions, oversights, and miscommunications.

The expected outcome for this objective was the development of standardized baseline risk scores for potential adverse events for at least 60% of high-risk steps, and the certification of at least 60% of these scores as an appropriate measure of risk by an expert panel. The actual outcome was the generation of reliable risk scores for 100% of the high-risk steps, of which up to 76% were certified by an expert panel as an appropriate measure of risk. When asked to characterize the technology, the panel indicated that the system accounts for all relevant risk factors that could affect patient outcomes (average Likert score of 9.33/10) and that our methodology represents an appropriate means of quantifying these factors and applying them to the patient experience (9.00/10).</p>\n<p>Our second technical objective was to conduct a risk analysis for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at UnityPoint (UP) St. Luke's Hospital. The expected outcome for this objective was a dataset that effectively identifies process-level risks across care settings for individual patients undergoing CABG at UP St. Luke's Hospital, as indicated by an average Likert score of 7/10 when evaluated for accuracy and appropriateness by an expert panel. In reality, the expert panel indicated our data is even more accurate (8.10/10) and clinically appropriate (8.20/10) than expected.

The expected outcome for this objective was an expert panel indicating that our data would improve upon existing risk-assessment standards and positively impact care quality with an average Likert score of 7/10, and simulations demonstrating that it improves outcomes with a p-value of less than 0.1. When assessed, the expert panel indicated that our data would improve upon existing risk-assessment methods/standards (8.83/10) and would improve the quality of patient care (9.17/10) more than expected. Furthermore, they estimated that a proactive risk identification software presenting this information to providers at the point of care may prevent up to 40% of all avoidable adverse events, including errors. In addition, the panel also asserted that such a system would be useful for planning/staffing/training (9.17/10) and patient safety huddles (9.33/10), would improve handoffs/transitions between providers (9.50/10), and would positively impact hospital culture regarding safety and risk reporting (9.00/10).

While our Phase I project focused on CABG, the long-term vision of Presaj is to improve patient safety in a large number of high-impact surgical procedures and medical conditions such as nosocomial infections and COVID-19.
