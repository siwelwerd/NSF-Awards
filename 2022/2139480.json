 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is to enhance the scientific and technological understanding of designing lift-assist exosuits (mechanized clothing), an assistive technology that has the potential to impact society by reducing the fatigue, back injury risk, and back pain of delivery drivers. For employers, the exosuit creates the potential for reduced employee turnover and medical costs.  The proposed exosuit has potential commercial impact as the first and only lift-assist exosuit for delivery workers, a ubiquitous and growing job sector that cuts across nearly all commercial markets. This project could additionally impact the economic competitiveness of the United States by increasing the available workforce and reducing the cost of healthcare for Americans.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address key design challenges associated with assistive technologies that provide lift-assistance for delivery drivers. Surmounting this technical hurdle relies on two key features: (1) the ability to turn assistance on/off when carrying an object, and (2) the ability to sit comfortably for long periods of time while driving. The research objectives of the Phase II project are to: 1) add a new mode-switching capability, 2) integrate a unique method of disengaging assistance that maximizes comfort during sitting, 3) create a novel leg sleeve to maximize comfort when the exosuit is not assisting, and 4) carry out a field study to validate exosuit performance in real-world conditions. This project will combine technical requirements and user stories with a series of rapid design iterations. Using this approach, multiple prototypes will be designed, built, and tested with delivery drivers to assess real-world performance and user acceptance. This project is projected to result in a commercially viable exosuit prototype that fits the daily needs of delivery drivers, as well as objective and subjective evidence of its efficacy in real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
