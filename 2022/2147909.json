 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few decades, cellular networks have evolved to deliver improved performance across increasingly heterogeneous components spanning the network edge (e.g., user devices) to base stations to traditional cloud backends. A key motivator behind these advances is to enhance the support for edge applications, especially video analysis (VA). Yet VA applications are currently not structured to fully leverage those advances. A primary issue is the lack of structured frameworks to develop and run VA applications, which in turn prevents the deployment and optimizations required to take advantage of all that cellular networks (and their edge-cloud hierarchies) have to offer. To tackle this limitation, the proposed work advocates for a re-designed VA software stack that explicitly ties VA operations  and requirements to the resources, interfaces, and vantage points that each platform element in a mobile edge-cloud hierarchy brings. To achieve this goal, the project takes a bottom-up, three-pronged approach that involves (1) developing a new object-oriented query language for VA applications that makes the aforementioned characteristics explicit and observable, (2) leveraging those features to develop a suite of resource-aware optimizations to VA computations that can operate under diverse (and restricted) edge constraints, and (3) designing a novel task placement engine that automatically adapts and operates VA applications across edge-cloud hierarchies.\r\n\r\nOwing to the widespread use of VA applications in sectors spanning traffic control, to autonomous vehicles, to disaster relief, the proposed research promises benefits to a large part of the population. The key improvements will come along two axes \u2013 (1) replacing painstaking manual analysis with automatic determination of the appropriate interactions between VA applications and emerging mobile networking infrastructure, and (2) democratizing the use of edge networking infrastructure \u2013 and will target two different groups. On the one hand, the proposed frameworks will simplify the creation of cutting-edge VA applications for developers by automatically deciding what public edge infrastructure to use and how to use it most effectively (in terms of cost, accuracy, and performance). On the other hand, the developed systems will assist network operators in identifying the most fruitful resource enhancements and helpful information about the platform to expose to application elements. The project also involves outreach efforts to attract students from populations currently under-represented in computer science. Key to these efforts is magnifying the interdisciplinary nature of edge-based VA applications that span mobile systems and networks, computer vision, programming languages, and machine learning. The software and research artifacts designed as part of this project are released on a regularly-maintained, public website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
