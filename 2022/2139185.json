 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description\r\nAtomically thin electronic materials developed recently could transform the current semiconductor industry built on bulk silicon and enable more powerful electronic devices with their extremely scaled thickness and unique physical properties.  However, the synthesis of atomically thin insulators with controllable atomic structures and electrical properties is a significant challenge.  This research projects seeks to develop a unique process to prepare atomically thin carbon-based insulators from solution-processable precursors.  Their atomic structures can be adjusted to optimize their properties for different demanding applications in electronics.  The thickness of the prepared insulating thin films can be precisely controlled down to atomic resolution, and they can be formed with excellent uniformity across the whole surface of semiconductor wafers.  Results from this project shed light on the structure-property relationship for atomically thin solids that lacks an ordered internal structure, and could technologically lead to faster, more powerful, and more portable cell phones and computers.  The project provides summer research internships for local high-school students from underrepresented groups and helps to develop a hands-on module with focus on the application of machine learning in material characterizations for undergraduates.  These outreach opportunities prepare sustainable, adaptable, and globally competitive science and engineering workforce to benefit US economy.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop two-dimensional (2D) amorphous carbon with unique atomic structures and material properties as a novel and transformative dielectric material for advanced electronic applications.  The project starts from developing a unique process to prepare 2D amorphous carbon monolayer with tunable degree of medium range ordering, based on the tiling and cross-linking of zero-dimensional carbon dots with intrinsic crystalline-amorphous core-shell structure as solution-processable precursors.  Layer-by-layer deposition further enables the precise control over the film thickness at atomic resolution.  Scientifically, the unique properties of the atomically thin 2D amorphous carbon will be correlated with the detailed atomic structures combining material characterizations, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and density-functional theory simulation.  Technologically, the 2D amorphous carbon monolayers and multilayers are used as the key dielectric component in 2D material-based transistors and memristors to enable enhanced device performance and reduced variability compared to their counterparts built on bulk metal oxides.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
