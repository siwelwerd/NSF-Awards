 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) instrument that will enable fundamental and applied research in the state of Oklahoma and surrounding region. The instrument will allow scientists and engineers to study the nano-scale structure of a wide variety of materials. These include polymers, fibers, composites, thin-films, liquid crystals, nanoparticles, detergents, emulsions, and biological materials. This instrument will also enable study of these materials under flow, and at elevated pressures and temperatures which are relevant to industrial processes. The research projects enabled by this instrument include those related to plastic recycling, drug delivery, and water treatment. Beyond state-of-the-art science, the award will also enhance the educational and training opportunities for students in Oklahoma by providing instrument access in an annual, two-day, hands-on training workshop.\r\n\r\nA SAXS instrument will be a valuable complement to existing instrument infrastructure in Oklahoma and will complement the electron microscopy instrumentation available in the state. SAXS is a valuable addition because the results obtained from SAXS are representative of the bulk material and not just the local portion(s) observed in electron micrographs. Micrographs, however, are much easier to interpret and do not rely on fitting the measured data to complex mathematical models, as SAXS does. By having access to both techniques, researchers can draw much stronger conclusions about their materials than would be possible with only one type of measurement. Importantly, SAXS is also non-destructive and analyzes the material\u2019s structure in its original state without any specialized additional equipment or sample preparation. The instrument\u2019s 2D detector will be valuable for anisotropic samples with aligned nano-scale structures, such as liquid crystals or flow-deformed particles. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Major Instrumentation Research Program (MRI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The instrument is also able to study the structure of these materials under flow and at elevated pressures and temperatures, relevant to a variety of industrial applications. The instrument is housed in a laboratory space in Keplinger Hall on TU&rsquo;s main campus in Tulsa, OK and is fully operational and in-use (see primary image). The instrument was installed in May 2023 and was commissioned over the summer of 2023, which included 4 days of on-site training by the instrument manufacturer. As of November 2023, a total of 24 independent users institutions (including 6 undergraduate researchers) from 5 different of higher education have been trained on how to use the instrument and/or have gathered data from experiments on the instrument. A majority of these users were trained at a hands-on workshop hosted by TU in August 2023 (see Other Images), which is being used as a catalyst to spur inter-institutional collaboration by training new users to make quality measurements and properly analyze their data. The workshop was successful and has improved the overall scientific training in the region, by exposing undergraduate- and graduate-level researchers to a new measurement technique and modern research equipment. The workshop included attendees from the state of Oklahoma, as well as from the surrounding region (Arkansas and Missouri). Data from measurements made on this instrument have been used as part of 3 abstracts of presentations made at national meetings/conferences, and it is being used to generate data for use in multiple PhD dissertations and research publications as of November 2023. Additionally, a teaching module regarding instrumentation and data analysis is being developed in order to further the impact of the instrument. The instrument has greatly enhanced the research capabilities at The University of Tulsa, itself, and for the Oklahoma region, overall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Javen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Weston</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2216074/2216074_10830406_1700685269789_IMG_3968--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2216074/2216074_10830406_1700685269789_IMG_3968--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SAXS Instrument\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2216074/2216074_10830406_1700685269789_IMG_3968--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SAXS Instrument\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Xeuss 3.0C SAXS/WAXS instrument housed in Keplinger Hall at the University of Tulsa.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Javen Weston</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Javen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Weston\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SAXS Instrument</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2216074/2216074_10830406_1700685353881_2023_Attendee_Picture--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2216074/2216074_10830406_1700685353881_2023_Attendee_Picture--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Workshop Attendees 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2216074/2216074_10830406_1700685353881_2023_Attendee_Picture--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop Attendees 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Attendees of the 2023 X-Ray Scattering Workshop at the University of Tulsa pictured at a networking poster session at the conclusion of the workshop.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hema Ramsurn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Javen&nbsp;S&nbsp;Weston\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Workshop Attendees 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
