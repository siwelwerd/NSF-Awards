 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by fostering student success and supporting the retention and graduation of domestic, high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a non-profit private institution. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 25 undergraduate students to pursue four-year bachelor\u2019s degrees in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer Engineering. Subsequently the scholars will pursue a one-year accelerated master\u2019s degree in one of the following areas: Software Engineering, Electrical, and Computer Engineering, or Cybersecurity Engineering. First-year students will receive up to five years of scholarship support. The project will increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with a newly created effective ecosystem that combines evidence-based practices such as faculty mentoring, academic advising, participation in the learning community, professional development activities, guidance in acquiring internships and research opportunities. With the help of mentors, the scholars will create individual development plans outlining their career goals and steps toward achieving those goals. The project will also include the evaluation of the impact of the ecosystem on supporting the academic success of scholars and the identification of best practices and lessons learned. This project will significantly contribute towards creating a model that actively engages students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields of study, broadens participation in STEM, and infuses 25 talented and diverse engineers with advanced degrees in engineering into the American workforce. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase undergraduate and graduate STEM degree completion of domestic, low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need in STEM field. Three specific aims guide the project. First is to deliver financial support to domestic, low-income, high-achieving students who will pursue an undergraduate and accelerated master\u2019s degree in engineering. Second is to leverage evidence-based practices to foster student success, increase retention and degree attainment. Third, and finally, is to evaluate the impact of the newly created ecosystem in supporting the academic success of scholars in engineering, and disseminate best practices and lessons learned. Little is known about the factors that affect the academic success of domestic, low-income, high-achieving undergraduate students in engineering fields at a private institution, and how factors such as gender, ethnic background and discipline impact their success, which is the focus of this project. Two research questions will be investigated in this project: (a) Does the academic success of scholars improve across the years by being part of this project? (b) What were the factors effecting the academic success of the scholars, and what are the accomplishments, best practices, and lessons learned from implementing the ecosystem for the scholars? This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
